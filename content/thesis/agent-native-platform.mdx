# Agent-native execution is the platform shift

We are at the beginning of a fundamental shift in how software gets built and operated.

## The claim

Agent-native platforms will become the dominant execution environment for software development, just as cloud-native platforms displaced on-premise infrastructure.

## Why now

1. **Language models can write code**: Not perfectly, but well enough to be useful
2. **Context windows are large enough**: Complex codebases fit in working memory
3. **Tool use is reliable**: Agents can invoke APIs, run commands, edit files
4. **Cost is dropping**: What was expensive is becoming cheap

## What agent-native means

An agent-native platform is designed from the ground up for autonomous software agents:

- **Workspaces are first-class**: Not an afterthought bolted onto VMs
- **Permissions are capability-based**: Fine-grained, auditable, revocable
- **State is snapshotted**: Every change is reversible
- **Interfaces are typed**: Agents interact with domains, not raw APIs

## The opportunity

The companies that build agent-native infrastructure will capture the value of the coming wave of AI-driven software development. This is our thesis.
