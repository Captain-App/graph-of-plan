# Agent-native execution is the platform shift

We are at the beginning of a fundamental shift in how software gets built and operated.

## The claim

Agent-native platforms will become the dominant execution environment for software development, just as cloud-native platforms displaced on-premise infrastructure.

## Why now

1. **Language models can write code**: Not perfectly, but well enough to be useful
2. **Context windows are large enough**: Complex codebases fit in working memory
3. **Tool use is reliable**: Agents can invoke APIs, run commands, edit files
4. **Cost is dropping**: What was expensive is becoming cheap

## What agent-native means

An agent-native platform is designed from the ground up for autonomous software agents:

- **Workspaces are first-class**: Not an afterthought bolted onto VMs
- **Permissions are capability-based**: Fine-grained, auditable, revocable
- **State is snapshotted**: Every change is reversible
- **Interfaces are typed**: Agents interact with domains, not raw APIs

## The opportunity

The companies that build agent-native infrastructure will capture the value of the coming wave of AI-driven software development. This is our thesis.

## Market Opportunity

We're not chasing a giant TAM. We're building for a specific niche: **teams deploying AI agents who need audit trails and sandboxed execution**.

### The Niche (Bottoms-Up)

**Nomos Cloud: AI teams needing compliance**

```
UK/US companies deploying AI agents in production:     ~5,000
× Need audit trails for compliance/governance:         × 40%
× Can pay £150+/mo for tooling:                       × 50%
= Addressable customers:                               1,000

At £150 ARPU + 10% enterprise at £25K ACV:
→ Niche opportunity: ~£4M ARR
```

**Murphy: Agencies with delivery pain**

```
UK/US digital agencies (5-50 staff):                   ~15,000
× Have multi-project delivery complexity:              × 30%
× Actively seeking delivery tooling:                   × 20%
= Addressable customers:                               900

At £600 blended ARPU:
→ Niche opportunity: ~£6M ARR
```

**SmartBoxes: Non-developers wanting AI automation**

```
UK/US solopreneurs/SMBs who would pay for AI tools:    ~500,000
× Specifically want "AI that builds for me":           × 2%
× Will pay £30+/mo:                                    × 30%
= Addressable customers:                               3,000

At £37 ARPU:
→ Niche opportunity: ~£1.3M ARR
```

**P4gent: Individuals managing supplier spend**

```
UK/US self-employed managing 10+ suppliers:            ~2M
× Aware of subscription/supplier management problem:   × 5%
× Will pay for tooling:                               × 10%
= Addressable customers:                               10,000

At £22 blended ARPU:
→ Niche opportunity: ~£2.6M ARR
```

### Total Niche: ~£14M ARR

This isn't a massive market. That's the point. It's a niche we can actually win with a small team, where:
- Customers have acute pain (compliance risk, delivery slips, time poverty)
- Willingness to pay is proven (competitors exist at similar price points)
- We have differentiation (Cloudflare-native, agent-first architecture)

### Revenue Targets

| Timeframe | MRR Target | ARR | Niche Penetration |
|-----------|------------|-----|-------------------|
| Year 1 | £100K | £1.2M | 9% |
| Year 2 | £400K | £4.8M | 34% |
| Year 3 | £800K | £9.6M | 69% |

**Year 1 breakdown by product (M12 MRR):**
- Nomos Cloud: £62K (61%) — highest ARPU, enterprise deals
- Murphy: £19K (19%) — agency wedge
- SmartBoxes: £17K (17%) — platform foundation
- P4gent: £3K (3%) — consumer experiment

### Why This Niche, Not Something Bigger?

1. **We can actually win it**: A £14M niche with 4 focused products is achievable
2. **Expansion is natural**: Winning the niche proves the platform for larger markets
3. **Competitors are weak here**: Big players don't care about £14M markets
4. **It's growing**: Agent deployment is accelerating; the niche expands with adoption
