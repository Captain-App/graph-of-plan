# Team

A small team trying to build useful software for people deploying AI agents.

## Founder

### Background

Technical background in distributed systems and AI infrastructure. Has built event-sourced systems, observability tooling, and production AI deployments. Knows Cloudflare's platform well.

### Why This Problem

Three frustrations from direct experience:

1. **Debugging AI systems without audit trails** is unpleasant. When something goes wrong, you're often guessing.
2. **Running agents without proper sandboxing** is nerve-wracking. The blast radius of mistakes is too large.
3. **Integrating agents with typed APIs** works better than raw HTTP calls, but most tooling doesn't support this well.

These problems might be solved by existing tools. But they weren't solved well enough when the founder needed them, so here we are.

### Motivation

We'd like to build a sustainable business solving these problems. The market might not be ready yet. The approach might be wrong. But the problems are real, and we think we can build something useful.

## Current Team

Small. The founder plus occasional contributors on specific pieces.

### How We Work

- Build on Cloudflare (they manage the infrastructure, we don't)
- Use our own tools where possible
- Ship things, see if they work, adjust

## Hiring

We'll need to hire if things go well. Probably:

**First hires (if we get traction):**
- Full-stack engineer who knows Cloudflare Workers
- Someone who can write documentation and talk to developers

**Later (if revenue supports it):**
- Product engineer for customer-facing work
- Someone who can sell to enterprises (for Nomos Cloud)

### What we look for

People who ship things and can write clearly. Background matters less than demonstrated ability to build.

## How We Work

- Remote, UK/EU timezones preferred
- Mostly async, meetings are rare
- We write things down rather than having long discussions
- We admit when we don't know things

## Contact

If you're interested, show us something you've built and tell us why you'd want to work on this. We're particularly interested in people who've experienced the problems we're trying to solve.
