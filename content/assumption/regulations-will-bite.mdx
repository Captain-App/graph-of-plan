# AI Regulations Will Be Enforced

> AI regulations (EU AI Act, emerging US frameworks) will be actively enforced within 24 months, creating compliance urgency.

## The Assumption

Audit trails become urgent when regulations bite. But will they? History suggests:
- GDPR took years before meaningful enforcement
- Tech regulation often has bark but no bite
- Lobbying can water down requirements
- Enforcement resources are limited

If regulations aren't enforced, audit trails remain "nice to have". Nomos Cloud loses urgency.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- EU AI Act has passed with specific requirements
- GDPR fines eventually became significant
- Financial services AI already heavily regulated
- Public pressure for AI accountability growing

**Counter-signals:**
- 36+ months before first AI Act enforcement likely
- US regulatory landscape fragmented and uncertain
- Enforcement requires technical expertise regulators lack
- Safe harbors and exceptions may be broad

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- 36 months pass with no meaningful enforcement
- Regulations focus on training, not runtime execution
- Safe harbor provisions make compliance trivial
- Enforcement targets only largest companies

## Impact If Wrong

If regulations don't bite:
- Audit trails become optional feature
- Nomos Cloud differentiation erodes
- Enterprise urgency disappears
- Need to lead with developer experience, not compliance

## Testing Plan

**Monitoring:**
- EU AI Act implementation timeline
- First enforcement actions
- Enterprise RFP language (do they ask about compliance?)
- Legal and compliance team involvement in AI purchases

**Timeline:** 24 months to meaningful signal

**Hedge:** Build audit trails anyway (useful for debugging), but don't over-invest in compliance-specific features until enforcement is real.
