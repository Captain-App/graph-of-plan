# Cloudflare Welcomes Agent Sandbox Workloads

> Cloudflare will continue to welcome agent sandbox workloads on their platform and not view them as abuse or undesirable traffic.

## The Assumption

We're building agent sandboxes on Cloudflare's infrastructure. But does Cloudflare actually want this use case? They might view agent execution as:
- Abuse of their platform
- Unprofitable traffic pattern
- Security risk to other customers
- Competition with their own products

If Cloudflare decides our workloads are unwelcome, we could be shut down with minimal warning.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Cloudflare has launched @cloudflare/sandbox for agent workloads
- Their pricing model suggests they want compute-heavy traffic
- No ToS language prohibiting our use case
- History of welcoming developer tooling companies

**Counter-signals:**
- Cloudflare could launch competing sandbox product
- Unprofitable customers get deprioritised
- Terms of Service can change
- Single tenant abuse could affect our account

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Cloudflare ToS changes to prohibit agent execution
- Account warned or suspended for usage patterns
- Cloudflare launches competing product and restricts third-party access
- Cloudflare sales tells us we're not a desired customer

## Impact If Wrong

If Cloudflare doesn't want us:
- Forced migration to AWS/GCP (6+ months work)
- Lost edge-first architecture advantage
- Higher costs, different developer experience
- Potential customer churn during migration

## Testing Plan

**Proactive:**
- Reach out to Cloudflare developer relations
- Ask explicitly if our use case is welcome
- Monitor their product roadmap for competing offerings

**Monitoring:**
- ToS changes
- Account health metrics
- Cloudflare announcements about agent workloads

**Mitigation:**
- Keep architecture as portable as possible
- Document migration path to alternatives
- Don't overly customise to Cloudflare-specific features
