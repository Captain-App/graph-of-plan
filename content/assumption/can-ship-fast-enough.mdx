# Can Ship Fast Enough

> A single founder with AI assistance can ship four products fast enough to test them before runway exhausts.

## The Assumption

We're betting that modern AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) provide enough productivity multiplier that a solo founder can:
- Ship SmartBoxes MVP in 4 months
- Launch Murphy alpha in parallel
- Get to revenue before runway exhausts
- Iterate based on feedback without burning out

This is an operational bet. If shipping takes 2x longer than planned, we won't have time to iterate and find product-market fit before running out of money.

## Evidence

**Current evidence:**
- Graph-of-plan shipped in ~2 weeks with AI assistance
- Shipbox prototype functional with agent-heavy development
- AI tools measurably improving research and boilerplate velocity

**Industry signals:**
- Solo founders shipping faster than ever (visible in Product Hunt, Indie Hackers)
- AI-assisted development becoming standard practice
- Successful precedents: Pieter Levels, Marc Lou shipping multiple products solo

**Counter-signals:**
- AI assistance has limits—novel architecture still requires deep thinking
- Integration work, edge cases, production hardening take human judgment
- Context-switching between products has hidden costs
- AI-generated code sometimes requires significant cleanup

## Counter-Evidence

**What would prove this wrong:**
- Shipping takes >3x planned time consistently
- AI assistance doesn't improve velocity on complex work
- Runway exhausts before any product reaches validation
- Burnout or health issues force slowdown

**Warning signs:**
- Milestones consistently slipping
- More time fixing AI-generated bugs than writing code
- Quality degrading under time pressure
- Finding excuses to avoid shipping

## Impact If Wrong

**Products affected:** All products delayed, but especially later-sequenced ones (Murphy, Nomos Cloud, P4gent)

**Runway impact:**
- At current burn (~£3K/month), runway exhausts in ~18 months
- If shipping takes 2x longer, we get one product validated instead of 2-3
- If 3x longer, we're dead before meaningful revenue

**Strategic impact:**
- May need to reduce scope (fewer products)
- May need to find co-founder or contractor help
- May need to raise capital earlier than planned

## Testing Plan

**Velocity tracking:**
1. Weekly: Hours worked vs. features shipped
2. Monthly: Milestone progress against plan
3. Quarterly: Runway recalculation with actual burn

**Leading indicators:**
- Are demos happening on schedule?
- Are features completing in estimated time?
- Is AI assistance saving time or creating rework?

**Course corrections:**
- If >2x behind at month 3: Reduce product scope
- If >2x behind at month 6: Seek help (co-founder, contractor, capital)
- If >3x behind: Consider pivot or shutdown

**Kill criteria:** If Month 4 arrives without functional SmartBoxes MVP, dramatically reassess the plan.
