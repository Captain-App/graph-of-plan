# Interview WTP Translates to Purchases

> Willingness to pay expressed in customer discovery interviews translates to actual credit card purchases at similar price points.

## The Assumption

Customer discovery interviews are the foundation of our pricing assumptions. When developers say "I'd pay $100/month for this", we assume they actually would. But interview WTP and actual WTP are often different:

- Interviewees want to be helpful and say yes
- Hypothetical money is easier to spend than real money
- Context matters—interview ≠ purchase moment
- Budgets, priorities, and alternatives change

All our pricing ($50-200/month for SmartBoxes) comes from stated WTP. If stated WTP is 3x actual WTP, our unit economics break.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Customer discovery is industry standard practice
- Experienced interviewers can calibrate for optimism
- Pre-orders and waitlists provide harder signals
- Competitive pricing provides anchor points

**Counter-signals:**
- "Would you pay X?" is a leading question
- People lie to interviewers (unconsciously)
- Interview context primes positive responses
- No skin in the game during interviews

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Actual conversion rates are 3x lower than interview-stated intent
- Achieved price points are 50%+ lower than stated WTP
- Free tier users refuse to convert despite prior stated intent
- Pricing experiments show much lower WTP than interviews suggested

## Impact If Wrong

If stated WTP is 3x actual WTP:
- $150/month stated → $50/month actual
- Unit economics break at lower prices
- Need more customers to hit revenue targets
- May need to find higher-WTP segments

## Testing Plan

**Validation:**
- Compare interview WTP to actual first purchases
- Track price sensitivity in conversion funnel
- Run pricing experiments (different price points shown)

**Calibration:**
- Ask "What do you currently pay for similar tools?"
- Ask "What would make this not worth it?"
- Use "Van Westendorp" price sensitivity questions

**Kill criteria:** If actual WTP is less than 50% of stated WTP, our pricing model needs major revision.
