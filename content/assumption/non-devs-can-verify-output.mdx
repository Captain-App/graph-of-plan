# Non-Developers Can Verify Agent Output

> Non-technical users can verify that AI agent output is correct without understanding the underlying code, enabling trust in agent actions.

## The Assumption

"Non-Developers Want AI Tools" assumes non-devs can use agents. But can they trust the output? If an agent writes code and executes it:
- How does a non-dev know if it worked?
- How do they catch errors?
- How do they verify correctness?

If non-devs can't verify output, they either:
- Trust blindly (dangerous)
- Require developer review (defeats the purpose)
- Don't use agents at all

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Non-devs verify Excel formula results by checking outputs
- No-code tools have visual feedback loops
- AI can explain its reasoning in plain language
- Sandboxing limits blast radius of errors

**Counter-signals:**
- Code output is often invisible (database changes, API calls)
- Errors may not be immediately apparent
- "It ran without errors" ≠ "It did the right thing"
- Non-devs don't know what questions to ask

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Non-devs frequently accept incorrect agent output
- Trust gap prevents non-dev adoption entirely
- Non-devs require developer review for all actions
- Support burden from "is this right?" questions unsustainable

## Impact If Wrong

If non-devs can't verify output:
- SmartBoxes TAM shrinks to developer-only
- P4gent becomes unviable
- Need to build heavy guardrails and approval workflows
- "AI for non-devs" positioning fails

## Testing Plan

**User testing:**
- Give non-devs tasks with known-incorrect agent output
- Measure: Do they catch the errors?
- Track trust levels and confidence

**Product design:**
- Build verification UX (show what agent did, in plain language)
- Test whether this enables non-dev verification
- Measure error catch rate

**Metrics:**
- Error detection rate by non-devs
- Trust scores over time
- Support ticket analysis
