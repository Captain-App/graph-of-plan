# Non-Developers Want AI Tools

> Non-technical users (SMB founders, operators) will want and use AI-powered tools that currently require developer skills.

## The Assumption

We're betting that the market for AI tools extends beyond developers. SMB founders, operators, and knowledge workers will want to:
- Run code without understanding code
- Automate workflows through natural language
- Use AI agents for tasks that previously required hiring developers
- Pay for tools that expand their capabilities

SmartBoxes targets this expanded market—not just developers who want sandboxes, but non-devs who want to run AI agents safely. If the market remains developer-only, our TAM shrinks 10x.

## Evidence

**Market signals:**
- No-code explosion: Zapier, Make, Airtable, Notion serving non-devs
- ChatGPT crossing into mainstream (100M+ users, mostly non-devs)
- Canva democratised design; we expect similar for code execution
- SMB founders increasingly comfortable with AI tools

**Behavioural signals:**
- Non-devs already asking "can AI do this?" for technical tasks
- Prompt engineering emerging as non-dev skill
- Notion AI, Jasper, Copy.ai serving non-technical writers
- Excel users learning formulas—similar learning curve to simple agents

**Counter-signals:**
- Code execution still feels dangerous/scary to non-devs
- Trust gap: non-devs don't know if agent is doing right thing
- Support burden from confused users could be high
- Developer tools that try to serve non-devs often fail at both

## Counter-Evidence

**What would prove this wrong:**
- Non-devs consistently fail onboarding
- Usage concentrated in developer segment (>90%)
- Support burden from non-devs unsustainably high
- Non-devs don't trust code execution, even sandboxed

**Warning signs:**
- Non-dev users churning immediately after signup
- Support tickets dominated by "I don't understand" questions
- Feature requests only from developers
- Non-dev users don't refer others

## Impact If Wrong

**Products affected:** SmartBoxes (partially), P4gent (entirely)

**TAM impact:**
- Developer-only market: ~1M potential customers
- Including non-devs: ~10M+ potential customers
- If wrong, 10x smaller addressable market

**Product impact:**
- Would need to focus exclusively on developer experience
- Would remove "no-code" positioning
- Would simplify product (no need for training wheels)
- P4gent becomes unviable as currently conceived

**GTM impact:**
- Content marketing shifts to pure developer focus
- Pricing can be higher (developers expense more easily)
- Competition more directly against E2B, Modal

## Testing Plan

**User research:**
1. 10 interviews with non-technical SMB founders
2. Beta cohort: Track dev vs. non-dev activation rates
3. Support ticket analysis: What questions do non-devs ask?

**Product experiments:**
- Test onboarding with zero-code users
- Measure time-to-first-success for non-devs
- A/B test "developer tool" vs. "AI automation" positioning

**Metrics:**
- Non-dev activation rate: Target >30% complete first task
- Non-dev retention: Target >20% weekly active after 30 days
- Non-dev NPS: Target >40

**Timeline:** 6 months into beta to get meaningful signal

**Kill criteria:** If under 10% of active users are non-developers after 6 months of beta, pivot to developer-only focus.
