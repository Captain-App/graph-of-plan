# Cloudflare Cost Structure Works

> Cloudflare's pricing model (Workers, Durable Objects, R2) will remain cost-competitive for our workload patterns and unit economics.

## The Assumption

Our entire technical architecture is built on Cloudflare primitives. We're betting that:
1. Current pricing remains stable (no >50% increases)
2. Our workload patterns align with their pricing model
3. Costs scale sub-linearly with usage (economies of scale, not diseconomies)
4. No hidden costs emerge at scale (egress, CPU limits, etc.)

This is a supplier concentration risk we're explicitly accepting in exchange for developer experience and time-to-market.

## Evidence

**Current evidence:**
- Dev costs tracking within projections (~$50/month at current scale)
- Workers pricing stable for 2+ years (no significant changes)
- Cloudflare's business model incentivises aggressive pricing (they want ecosystem lock-in)
- No egress fees (unlike AWS/GCP)—reduces cost surprises

**Pricing model analysis:**
- Workers: $0.50/million requests (paid plan) — predictable
- Durable Objects: $0.15/million requests + $0.15/GB-month storage — potentially expensive at scale
- R2: $0.015/GB-month storage, no egress — very competitive
- D1: $0.75/million reads, $1.00/million writes — reasonable

**Risk factors:**
- Durable Objects could become expensive with high-frequency access patterns
- CPU time limits (50ms free, 30s paid) could limit compute-heavy agents
- Cloudflare's pricing power increases as we become more dependent

## Counter-Evidence

**What would prove this wrong:**
- Cloudflare raises prices >50% on core primitives
- Our workload patterns hit expensive tiers unexpectedly
- Gross margin under 50% at projected 1,000-customer scale
- Egress fees introduced (breaking a key advantage)

**Warning signs to monitor:**
- Cloudflare quarterly earnings mentioning pricing changes
- Developer community complaints about cost surprises
- Our own bills growing faster than usage

## Impact If Wrong

**Products affected:** All products—SmartBoxes, Nomos Cloud, Murphy, P4gent

**Technical impact:** Would need to:
- Re-architect for AWS/GCP (6+ months of work)
- Accept higher baseline costs
- Lose edge-first deployment model
- Rebuild around different primitives (Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)

**Financial impact:**
- At 1,000 customers, 50% cost increase = ~£2,000/month additional COGS
- Could flip unit economics from profitable to unprofitable
- Runway consumed faster if we need to migrate

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Keep architecture portable where possible
- Monitor costs weekly, not monthly
- Set alerts for cost anomalies
- Maintain relationship with Cloudflare (startup credits, communication)

## Testing Plan

**Ongoing monitoring:**
1. Weekly cost review: Track spend per primitive
2. Unit economics model: Update with real data as usage grows
3. Cloudflare communications: Monitor announcements, earnings calls
4. Competitive pricing: Track AWS/GCP/Fly.io/Modal alternatives

**Stress testing:**
- Model 10x usage scenarios before they happen
- Identify which primitives become expensive at scale
- Have migration plan documented (even if we never use it)

**Review frequency:** Quarterly (or immediately if pricing announced)

**Kill criteria:** If costs exceed 30% of revenue at target scale, evaluate migration.
