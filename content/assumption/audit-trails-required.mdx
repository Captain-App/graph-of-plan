# Audit Trails Will Be Required

> As AI agents make autonomous decisions in production, enterprises will require comprehensive audit trails for compliance, debugging, and governance.

## The Assumption

Nomos Cloud's value proposition is built on audit trails becoming mandatory, not optional. We're betting that:
1. Regulatory bodies will require explainability for AI decisions
2. Enterprise compliance teams will block agent deployment without trails
3. Debugging autonomous systems requires detailed execution history
4. Governance frameworks will mandate decision logging

If companies can get away without audit trails—if it remains a "nice-to-have"—the urgency disappears and Nomos Cloud becomes a low-priority purchase.

## Evidence

**Regulatory signals:**
- EU AI Act explicitly addresses AI transparency and record-keeping
- GDPR Article 22 already covers automated decision-making rights
- US agencies (SEC, FTC) investigating AI decision-making
- Financial services already require extensive audit trails

**Enterprise behaviour:**
- SOC 2 compliance requires audit logging for sensitive systems
- Security teams increasingly asking "can we trace AI decisions?"
- Legal teams concerned about liability from opaque AI
- Insurance implications of unexplainable agent actions

**Market signals:**
- LangSmith, Helicone gaining traction in observability space
- "AI governance" emerging as enterprise software category
- Startups raising for AI compliance tools

**Counter-signals:**
- Most AI deployments today have minimal observability
- Startups move fast and add compliance later
- Audit trails add latency and cost
- "If it works, who cares how?" attitude common

## Counter-Evidence

**What would prove this wrong:**
- Regulations remain silent on agent observability
- Enterprises deploy agents without governance
- Audit trails seen as optional nice-to-have
- Competitors win without strong audit features

**Warning signs:**
- Enterprise prospects don't ask about audit trails
- Compliance teams not involved in agent tool purchases
- Regulations focus on model training, not agent execution
- "Move fast" culture dominates over governance

## Impact If Wrong

**Products affected:** Nomos Cloud primarily

**Revenue at risk:** £62K+ Year 2 (Nomos revenue + enterprise deals)

**Strategic impact:**
- Nomos Cloud becomes observability-only (smaller market)
- Differentiation from LangSmith/Helicone erodes
- Enterprise sales cycle shortens (fewer stakeholders)
- May need to pivot Nomos value prop

**Positioning impact:**
- "Audit trails" messaging becomes liability if not demanded
- Would need to lead with developer experience instead
- Governance features become cost, not selling point

## Testing Plan

**Regulatory monitoring:**
1. Track EU AI Act implementation timeline and requirements
2. Monitor US regulatory guidance on AI agents
3. Follow industry working groups (AI governance standards)

**Enterprise discovery:**
1. 5 interviews with enterprise compliance/security teams
2. Analyse RFPs for AI tooling—are audit trails mentioned?
3. Survey enterprise AI teams on governance priorities

**Market signals:**
1. Track funding in AI compliance/governance startups
2. Monitor LangSmith/Helicone feature development
3. Attend enterprise AI conferences, track session topics

**Timeline:** 6 months to clearer regulatory signal

**Kill criteria:** If 12 months pass with no regulatory movement AND 0/5 enterprise prospects mention compliance, deprioritise governance features.
