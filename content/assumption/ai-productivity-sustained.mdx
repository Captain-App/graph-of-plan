# AI Productivity Gains Are Sustained

> AI coding assistance (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) productivity gains will sustain beyond the novelty period and continue improving.

## The Assumption

"Can Ship Fast Enough" depends entirely on AI productivity. But current evidence might be novelty effect:
- New tool excitement drives engagement
- Learning curve hasn't hit yet
- Hard problems haven't been encountered
- AI limitations not yet discovered

If productivity gains fade after 6 months, the solo founder model fails.

## Evidence

**Current evidence:**
- Graph-of-plan shipped with heavy AI assistance
- Shipbox prototype functional
- Subjective sense of significant speedup

**Supporting signals:**
- AI tools improving quarter over quarter
- Industry reports showing sustained productivity gains
- Successful precedents of AI-augmented solo founders

**Counter-signals:**
- Novelty effect is real and well-documented
- AI generates plausible-but-wrong code that requires debugging
- Complex architecture still requires human judgment
- Context limits mean AI loses track of large projects

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Productivity gains fade noticeably after 6 months
- Time spent fixing AI errors exceeds time saved
- AI tools plateau or degrade in capability
- Complex problems remain intractable with AI help

## Impact If Wrong

If AI productivity doesn't sustain:
- Shipping takes 2-3x longer than planned
- 4 products becomes 1-2 products
- Runway exhausts before validation
- Need co-founder or contractors

## Testing Plan

**Tracking:**
- Personal productivity metrics over time
- Time per feature (objective)
- Subjective productivity rating (weekly)
- AI vs. manual time split

**External signals:**
- Industry reports on AI coding tool effectiveness
- Other solo founders' experiences
- AI tool capability announcements

**Review:** Monthly comparison against baseline

**Kill criteria:** If Month 6 productivity is less than 50% of Month 1 productivity, reassess the solo model.
