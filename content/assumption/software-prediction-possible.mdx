# Software Project Prediction Is Possible

> Software project delivery timelines can be predicted with useful accuracy (within 30% of actual) by AI analysis of project data.

## The Assumption

Murphy's entire value proposition is predicting when software projects will deliver. But is this even possible?

**The hard truth:** "Why is software always late?" has been asked for 50 years. No tool has solved it. Maybe it's unsolvable:
- Software projects are complex adaptive systems
- Requirements change mid-project
- Dependencies are hidden until they bite
- Human factors dominate technical factors

If prediction isn't possible, Murphy is selling snake oil.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Some patterns are predictable (velocity trends, scope creep signals)
- AI can process more data than humans
- Monte Carlo simulations provide probabilistic forecasts
- Early warning is valuable even if not precise

**Counter-signals:**
- 50 years of failed prediction tools
- Fundamental uncertainty in creative work
- Garbage in, garbage out (project data is messy)
- Goodhart's Law: measured metrics get gamed

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Predictions consistently off by over 50%
- No better accuracy than naive estimates (e.g., "double the estimate")
- False positives cause alarm fatigue
- Agencies don't trust the predictions

## Impact If Wrong

If prediction isn't possible:
- Murphy fails regardless of execution
- Pivot to different value prop (project visibility, not prediction)
- Or abandon Murphy entirely
- Agency expertise becomes less valuable

## Testing Plan

**Technical validation:**
- Build prediction model on historical data
- Backtest against known outcomes
- Measure accuracy: % of predictions within 30% of actual

**Customer validation:**
- Are predictions more useful than gut feel?
- Do early warnings provide actionable lead time?
- Do agencies change behavior based on predictions?

**Kill criteria:** If predictions aren't better than "multiply PM estimate by 1.5", pivot the value prop.
