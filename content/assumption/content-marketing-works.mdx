# Content Marketing Works For Us

> Technical content about edge computing and agent infrastructure will generate qualified leads for our products.

## The Assumption

Our PLG strategy depends on content marketing driving top-of-funnel awareness. We're betting that:
1. We can write compelling technical content
2. There's an audience for edge computing and agent infrastructure content
3. That audience overlaps with potential buyers
4. Content → signups → paid conversion funnel works

None of these are guaranteed. Many technical founders underestimate content effort or overestimate their audience.

## Evidence

**Developer content success stories:**
- Vercel, Netlify built massive audiences through technical blogs
- Supabase grew through content + community
- Cloudflare's blog drives significant developer awareness
- Individual developers (Tanner Linsley, Theo) built audiences that drive product adoption

**Content-market fit signals:**
- "Edge computing" and "AI agents" are trending topics
- Developer Twitter/LinkedIn engagement on these topics high
- Podcasts, newsletters emerging in the space
- Conference talks on these topics well-attended

**Counter-signals:**
- Content creation takes time away from product development
- Audience building is slow (months, not weeks)
- Most content efforts fail quietly
- Competition for attention is fierce

## Counter-Evidence

**What would prove this wrong:**
- 6 months of publishing with fewer than 50 followers
- Zero conversions from content
- Engagement metrics consistently poor (under 10 likes/post)
- Time spent on content not translating to signups

**Warning signs:**
- Posts get no engagement
- Writing feels like a chore, quality suffers
- Audience grows but doesn't convert
- Time spent on content delays product shipping

## Impact If Wrong

**Products affected:** All products (content drives awareness for everything)

**GTM impact:**
- Would need paid acquisition (higher CAC)
- Would need partnerships/integrations for distribution
- Would need to find alternative channels (open source, communities)

**Runway impact:**
- Paid acquisition burns cash faster
- Longer time to meaningful revenue
- May need to raise earlier

**Alternative strategies:**
- Product Hunt launches
- Integration partnerships (Vercel, Supabase, etc.)
- Open source components that drive adoption
- Community building in existing spaces (Discord, Reddit)

## Testing Plan

**Content experiment (3 months):**
1. Publish 1 substantive technical post per week
2. Track followers, engagement, website traffic
3. Track signups attributed to content
4. Measure time spent vs. results

**Metrics to track:**
- Followers: Target 100+ in 3 months
- Engagement: Target 25+ meaningful interactions per post
- Website traffic: Track content → product page flow
- Signups: Track referral source

**Content types to test:**
- Tutorial content (how to build X with Cloudflare Workers)
- Opinion content (why agents need sandboxes)
- Technical deep dives (edge computing patterns)
- Build-in-public updates (progress on SmartBoxes)

**Timeline:** 3 months to initial signal, 6 months to clear verdict

**Kill criteria:** If 6 months of publishing with fewer than 50 followers and fewer than 5 signups from content, deprioritise content marketing.

**Depends on:**
- [PLG Works For Infrastructure](/assumption/plg-works-for-infra) — content only matters if PLG is the right GTM motion

**Supports:**
- [Build In Public](/guiding-policy/build-in-public) — content is the execution of this policy

**Competes for time with:**
- [Can Ship Fast Enough](/assumption/can-ship-fast-enough) — content time vs. product time

**Addresses constraint:**
- [No Audience](/constraint/no-audience) — content is the solution to this constraint
