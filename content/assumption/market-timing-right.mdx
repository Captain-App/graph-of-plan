# Market Timing Is Right

> The market for agent infrastructure is emerging now, and we're early enough to establish position but not so early that we'll exhaust runway waiting.

## The Assumption

Timing is one of the hardest things to get right. We're betting on a Goldilocks window:

**Not too early:**
- Customers understand the need for agent infrastructure
- Budget exists for agent tooling
- Technical patterns are established enough to build on

**Not too late:**
- Incumbents haven't locked up the market
- Category definitions still fluid
- Early movers can establish positioning

## Evidence

**"Now is the time" signals:**
- Claude, GPT-4, Gemini all capable of autonomous code execution
- Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT) gaining adoption
- Competitors raising funding (E2B, Modal, etc.) — validates market
- Cloudflare investing in agent infrastructure (@cloudflare/sandbox)
- Enterprise AI spending increasing rapidly

**Market maturity indicators:**
- "AI agents" recognised term (not needing explanation)
- Job postings for "AI/ML platform engineer" increasing
- Conference tracks dedicated to agent infrastructure
- VC firms raising AI-focused funds

**Counter-signals:**
- Many agent projects are demos, not production systems
- "AI winter" risk if hype cycle crashes
- May still be too early for enterprises (security concerns)
- Regulatory uncertainty creating buyer hesitation

## Counter-Evidence

**Too early signals:**
- Customers say "maybe next year"
- Education costs dominate sales conversations
- No competitor activity for 12+ months
- Agent hype cycle crashes

**Too late signals:**
- Big tech announces competing products
- Incumbents (AWS, GCP) enter with agent platforms
- Category leaders emerge with dominant market share
- Pricing pressure from well-funded competitors

**Current assessment:**
- Neither extreme seems true today
- Market is active but not overcrowded
- Customers curious but not yet urgent
- Window may be 12-24 months

## Impact If Wrong

**If too early:**
- Runway exhausts waiting for market to materialise
- Education costs eat into margins
- Pivot required to sustain business
- May need to hibernate and restart later

**If too late:**
- Dominant players already established
- Forced into niche positioning
- Pricing pressure from well-funded competitors
- May need to find adjacent market

**Products affected:** All products, but SmartBoxes most directly

**Strategic options if wrong:**
- Too early: Extend runway, consult while waiting, pivot to adjacent market
- Too late: Niche down, differentiate on specific use case, consider acquisition

## Testing Plan

**Market signals to monitor:**

**Weekly:**
- Competitor launches and funding announcements
- Developer community activity (GitHub stars, Discord activity)
- Social media engagement on agent topics

**Monthly:**
- Sales conversation quality (urgency, budget, timeline)
- Competitor pricing changes
- Conference and event activity

**Quarterly:**
- Enterprise AI spending reports
- Analyst coverage of agent infrastructure
- Regulatory developments

**Leading indicators of "too early":**
- Sales cycles >6 months consistently
- "Let's talk next quarter" as common response
- Demos but no trials, trials but no purchases

**Leading indicators of "too late":**
- Competitors announcing enterprise deals
- Price wars starting
- Customers asking "why not [incumbent]?"

**Timeline:** Continuous monitoring, quarterly assessment

**Kill criteria:** If 12 months pass with no meaningful revenue AND competitors not succeeding either, market may not exist. If competitors raising late-stage rounds while we have no traction, we may be too late.
