# Breadth Beats Depth For Market Learning

> Shipping 4 products at 70% quality beats shipping 1 product at 95% quality for learning what the market wants.

## The Assumption

The plan includes 4 products: SmartBoxes, Murphy, Nomos Cloud, P4gent. This is a portfolio bet—we don't know which will win, so we're testing multiple.

But is breadth actually better? Counter-arguments:
- Infrastructure rewards depth (reliability, trust, features)
- Context-switching destroys productivity
- "Jack of all trades, master of none"
- 70% quality might not cross the threshold for any product

Maybe 1 product at 95% beats 4 at 70%.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Startups are search processes—more experiments, more learning
- Early-stage products don't need to be perfect
- Market feedback is more valuable than polish
- Successful founders often explored multiple ideas

**Counter-signals:**
- Infrastructure has higher quality bar than apps
- Users don't forgive buggy developer tools
- Splitting attention means nothing gets done well
- Compounding: depth in one area builds moat

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- All 4 products fail due to insufficient quality
- Context-switching prevents any product reaching the bar
- Market clearly rewards depth (competitors with 1 product win)
- No meaningful learnings transfer between products

## Impact If Wrong

If depth beats breadth:
- Narrow focus to 1-2 products immediately
- Accept slower market learning
- Build deeper moat in chosen area
- Change sequencing strategy

## Testing Plan

**Signal quality:**
- Track learnings per product (are they distinct?)
- Track cross-product learnings (do insights transfer?)
- Compare signal quality: 1 deep product vs. 4 shallow?

**Quality bar:**
- Are any products crossing the "good enough" threshold?
- User feedback: is quality a blocker?

**Review:** Quarterly assessment of portfolio vs. focus strategy
