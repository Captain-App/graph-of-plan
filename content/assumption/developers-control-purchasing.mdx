# Developers Control Purchasing

> Individual developers can make purchasing decisions for tools under $200/month without procurement approval in their organisations.

## The Assumption

PLG (product-led growth) assumes developers can self-serve. But can they actually pay? In many organisations, developers don't have purchasing authority. Even a $50/month tool might require:
- Manager approval
- Procurement review
- Security assessment
- Vendor onboarding

If developers can't buy without friction, PLG fails. We'd need enterprise sales from day one.

## Evidence

**Supporting signals:**
- Vercel, Netlify, Supabase grew through individual developer purchases
- Many developers have corporate cards for small tool purchases
- "Shadow IT" exists—developers buy tools and expense them
- Startups and small teams have minimal procurement friction

**Counter-signals:**
- Enterprise security increasingly blocks unapproved tools
- Zero-trust security models require vendor review
- Developers at big companies often lack purchasing authority
- Remote work increased security scrutiny on tool usage

## What Would Prove This Wrong

- Most deals stall at procurement review
- Average sales cycle exceeds 30 days even for small amounts
- Enterprise security consistently blocks SmartBoxes
- Developers self-report no purchasing authority in surveys

## Impact If Wrong

If developers can't buy, PLG doesn't work. We'd need to:
- Sell to enterprises top-down
- Build for procurement (SOC 2, security questionnaires, legal review)
- Accept longer sales cycles and higher CAC
- Price higher to cover sales costs

## Testing Plan

**Early signals:**
- Track time from signup to paid conversion
- Ask in onboarding: "Do you have purchasing authority?"
- Monitor where deals stall in the funnel

**Validation:**
- Over 50% of conversions without procurement involvement
- Average signup-to-paid under 7 days

**Kill criteria:** If less than 20% of signups can self-convert, pivot to sales-led.
