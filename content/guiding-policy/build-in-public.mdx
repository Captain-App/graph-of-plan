# Build In Public

Create audience during development through content. Turn the building process into distribution.

## The Policy

Document the journey:
1. Write about technical challenges we solve
2. Share architecture decisions and trade-offs
3. Show progress transparently (even when slow)
4. Engage with the communities where our customers live

## Why We Think This Works

- **Distribution**: Content accumulates while we build the product
- **Credibility**: Technical depth attracts technical buyers
- **Compounding**: Old content continues to drive traffic
- **Filtering**: People who find us through content already understand the problem

## Constraints It Navigates

- **No audience?** - Build it while building product, not after
- **Single founder?** - Writing about what you're building requires minimal extra effort
- **Limited capital?** - Content marketing has near-zero marginal cost

## What We Write About

- Cloudflare Workers patterns and edge architecture
- Event sourcing for AI observability
- Building agent-native infrastructure
- Lessons learned from shipping

## The Metrics That Matter

Not vanity metrics (followers). Engagement metrics (saves, shares, conversations) and conversion metrics (signups from content).
