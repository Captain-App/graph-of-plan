# Dogfood First

Be our own first customer. Prove value by using our products to build our products.

## The Policy

Before selling to external customers:
1. Use the product ourselves in production
2. Find the friction points through actual use
3. Validate that it solves real problems (our problems)
4. Build features we actually need

## Why We Think This Works

- **Credibility**: "We use this every day" beats "We think you'll like it"
- **Faster feedback**: We get signal on what works without waiting for user research
- **Better prioritisation**: We build what matters, not what sounds good in a pitch deck
- **Higher quality**: We feel the pain of our own bugs

## Constraints It Navigates

- **No audience?** - We don't need users to validate the core proposition
- **Single founder?** - Using our own tools makes us more productive, not less
- **Limited capital?** - Dogfooding is free and provides higher-fidelity signal than paid research

## The Risk

We might build for our own edge cases rather than the broader market. That's why dogfooding is necessary but not sufficient.
