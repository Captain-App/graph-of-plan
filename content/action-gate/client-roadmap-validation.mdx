# Client Uses Murphy for Roadmap

Get at least one client to use Murphy to agree the roadmap of their project.

## The Action

This is the validation gate for the [chain-link strategy](/diagnosis/chain-link-illegibility). When a client uses Murphy to agree the roadmap of their project, we have a product.

## Why This Gates Progress

The chain-link structure is illegible until demonstrated. We can't prove the thesis with words—only with a working example of an external user getting value from both links working together.

## What This Proves

| Criterion | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| External user (not us) | We're not just building for ourselves |
| Real stakes (actual project) | Not a demo or favour |
| Murphy thesis validated | Planning as contract works in practice |
| Transferability proven | Works for someone who didn't build it |

## Why This Is The Critical Gate

Before this gate:
- SmartBoxes is infrastructure without a moat
- Murphy is a vision without proof
- The chain is illegible to outsiders

After this gate:
- We have a demonstrable product
- The strategy becomes legible through demonstration
- Distribution becomes possible because proof exists

## Proxy Metric

**[Client Projects Using Murphy](/proxy-metric/murphy-client-projects)**: 0 → 1

This is a binary validation gate, but the metric tracks progress toward it.

## Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| SmartBoxes (ship-box-dev) | ~90% — needs debugging/polish |
| Murphy | Blocked on SmartBoxes |
| Client projects | Exist, structured as requirements/issues |
| Client validation | Blocked on Murphy |

**Critical path:** Debug ship-box-dev → Build Murphy on it → Present roadmap to client → Validation
