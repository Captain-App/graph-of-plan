# Internal Daily Use

Use SmartBox ourselves for 10+ hours per week of actual productive work.

## The Action

Use SmartBox as our primary development environment for building SmartBox and other products. Not testing - actual work.

## Why This Gates Progress

If we can't use our own product for real work, we have no business selling it. This gate ensures we've crossed the threshold from "demo-able" to "usable".

## What 10+ Hours Means

- Not leaving it running in the background
- Not testing features
- Actual productive development work
- Replacing other tools, not supplementing them
