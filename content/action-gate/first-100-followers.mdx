# First 100 Followers

Publish 10 technical posts and grow to 100 engaged followers.

## The Action

1. Publish 10 substantive technical posts about edge computing, agent architecture, or event sourcing
2. Grow to 100 followers who engage (not purchased or bot accounts)
3. Achieve at least 3 posts with 50+ meaningful engagements

## Why This Gates Progress

This gate validates that build-in-public works for us specifically. It proves we can:
- Write content people want to read
- Reach people outside our immediate network
- Convert attention into following

## What 100 Followers Means

Quality over quantity:
- People who would plausibly become customers
- Technical audience matching our ICP
- Engaged (comment, share) not just passive
