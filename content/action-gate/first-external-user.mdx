# First External User

Get one person outside the team to complete a real task in SmartBox.

## The Action

Find one design partner willing to:
1. Sign up and onboard independently (with support available)
2. Attempt a real task they need done
3. Complete that task using SmartBox
4. Provide honest feedback on the experience

## Why This Gates Progress

Internal use validates capability. External use validates onboarding, documentation, and whether the product makes sense to someone who didn't build it.

## What "Real Task" Means

- Something they would have done anyway
- Not a favour or artificial test
- Has a meaningful outcome they care about
- Representative of target use cases
