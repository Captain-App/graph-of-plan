# Dogfood Before Selling

> We use SmartBoxes ourselves for real work before selling it to customers.

## Context

We could start selling SmartBoxes immediately after MVP, or use it internally first to validate and refine. This decision affects product quality, time-to-revenue, and our ability to speak authentically about the product.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why Not Chosen |
|--------|----------------|
| **Immediate beta release** | Faster revenue but risk of poor first impressions, bugs in production, support burden |
| **Paid alpha with early adopters** | Revenue earlier but requires support capacity we don't have, could damage reputation |
| **Skip internal use entirely** | Fastest to market but we'd be selling something we don't believe in |

## The Decision

Use SmartBoxes ourselves for real work for at least 4 weeks before inviting external users.

**What "real work" means:**
- Using SmartBoxes to develop Murphy and other products
- Running AI agents for actual tasks (code generation, data processing)
- Treating it as our primary development environment, not a demo
- Documenting what works, what breaks, what's confusing

**Why dogfooding:**
1. **Validates the product** — if we won't use it, why would anyone else?
2. **Finds bugs before customers** — we're the first angry users
3. **Generates authentic content** — real stories, not manufactured examples
4. **Builds conviction** — we know the product intimately when selling
5. **Creates case study** — "we built X with SmartBoxes" is credible proof

## Tradeoffs Accepted

**What we're giving up:**
- Delays time to first external user by 4+ weeks
- May over-optimise for our own use case (developer, solo, specific workflows)
- Risk of building in a bubble (no external feedback)
- Revenue starts later

**What we're accepting:**
- Need to balance dogfooding time with shipping pressure
- Our use case may not represent typical customer
- May discover product doesn't work for our needs (good to know early)

## Reversal Triggers

Revisit this decision if:
- 4 weeks pass without meaningful internal use (we're not actually dogfooding)
- External demand too strong to delay (waitlist overflowing, press interest)
- Internal use case too different from target market (we're not learning relevant lessons)
- Runway constraints require faster revenue (burn rate higher than expected)

**Early warning signs:**
- Finding excuses not to use SmartBoxes ourselves
- Preferring other tools for "real work"
- Internal bugs not being fixed (low priority)
- No content/stories emerging from internal use

## Review Schedule

**Next review:** 2025-03-15 (or at 4-week mark)

**Review questions:**
1. Have we logged 10+ hours/week of SmartBoxes usage?
2. What have we learned about the product?
3. What bugs/issues have we found and fixed?
4. Are we ready for external users?
