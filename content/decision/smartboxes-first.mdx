# SmartBoxes First

> We launch SmartBoxes as our first product rather than Murphy, P4gent, or Nomos Cloud.

## Context

We have four product ideas, each targeting different markets and requiring different capabilities. With a single founder and limited runway, we can only focus on one at a time. The choice determines how we build audience, validate assumptions, and generate early revenue.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why Not Chosen |
|--------|----------------|
| **Murphy first** | Clearer ICP (agencies) but requires more domain expertise, longer sales cycles, less content potential |
| **Nomos Cloud first** | Higher enterprise value but longest sales cycle, requires more infrastructure, less PLG-friendly |
| **P4gent first** | Simpler product but smaller market, requires SmartBox capability first anyway |
| **Parallel development** | Spreads risk but fatally dilutes focus, none would ship properly |

## The Decision

Launch SmartBoxes first, use it to build audience and revenue, then sequence other products.

**Why SmartBoxes:**
1. **Dogfooding** — we can use SmartBoxes to build SmartBoxes (and Murphy, and everything else)
2. **Broad market** — targets developers AND non-devs, largest potential audience
3. **Content engine** — AI agent stories generate natural content (failures, successes, learnings)
4. **Lowest sales complexity** — PLG-friendly, self-serve, no enterprise procurement
5. **Horizontal platform** — capabilities built here enable other products

**Sequencing after SmartBoxes:**
- Murphy (months 4-7): Uses SmartBox, targets agencies, builds on content audience
- Nomos Cloud (months 8-12): Longer build, enterprise sales, needs SmartBox maturity
- P4gent (months 6-10): Experimental, needs SmartBox and non-dev validation

## Tradeoffs Accepted

**What we're giving up:**
- Murphy may have faster path to revenue (clearer buyer persona, agencies have budget)
- Enterprise Nomos deals could be 10x larger per customer
- Opportunity cost if SmartBoxes market smaller than expected
- May not build enterprise muscle needed for Nomos later

**What we're accepting:**
- SmartBoxes market is less proven than agency market
- PLG bet may not work for infrastructure
- Need to validate "non-devs want AI tools" assumption

## Reversal Triggers

Revisit this decision if:
- SmartBoxes market validation fails after 6 months (no traction, no signal)
- Inbound demand emerges for a different product (agencies asking for Murphy unprompted)
- Strategic partnership requires different product (e.g., Cloudflare wants Nomos integration)
- Competition makes SmartBoxes untenable (E2B raises $50M and dominates)

**Early warning signs:**
- SmartBoxes signups low despite content effort
- All interest coming from agencies (wrong product first)
- Competitors moving faster than we can match
- Technical challenges consuming all bandwidth

## Review Schedule

**Next review:** 2025-06-01

**Review questions:**
1. Is SmartBoxes showing traction (signups, usage, revenue)?
2. Has inbound demand emerged for other products?
3. Are competitors invalidating SmartBoxes positioning?
4. Is the sequencing still right?
