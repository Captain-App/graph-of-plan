# Credits Over Subscription

> SmartBoxes uses a prepaid credits model (PAYG) rather than a traditional SaaS subscription.

## Context

SmartBoxes needs a pricing model. The choice affects revenue predictability, user behaviour, churn dynamics, and competitive positioning. Three main options:
- **Monthly subscription**: Predictable revenue, traditional SaaS model
- **Pure usage-based**: Pay exactly for what you use, risk of bill shock
- **Prepaid credits**: Top up credits, consume as you go, no surprises

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why Not Chosen |
|--------|----------------|
| **Monthly subscription** | Misaligned with variable value delivery—some months users run 100 sandboxes, some months 2. Subscription feels unfair for power tool with spiky usage |
| **Pure usage-based** | Risk of bill shock scares users, harder to predict revenue, may attract only heavy users |
| **Freemium + subscription** | Complex to implement, unclear where free ends, may attract non-converting users |

## The Decision

Prepaid credits model where users top up credits that are consumed by usage.

**How it works:**
- Users purchase credit packs ($10, $50, $200, etc.)
- Each sandbox session consumes credits based on time + resources
- Credits don't expire (or expire after 12 months)
- Low balance triggers reminder to top up

**Why credits:**
1. **Aligns payment with value delivered** — you pay for what you use
2. **Avoids bill shock** — users can't overspend since credits are prepaid
3. **Provides revenue predictability** — prepayments give visibility
4. **Creates natural pause points** — users reassess value when topping up rather than churning silently
5. **Feels fairer** — PAYG model matches expectations for infrastructure

## Tradeoffs Accepted

**What we're giving up:**
- Less predictable MRR than subscription (harder to forecast)
- Need to manage credit balances and top-up UX (additional complexity)
- May attract lower-commitment users (no monthly commitment)
- Harder to compare to subscription competitors (different mental model)

**What we're accepting:**
- Revenue will be lumpier (big top-ups, then quiet periods)
- Need clear communication on credit consumption rates
- May need to add subscription tier later for enterprise

## Reversal Triggers

Revisit this decision if:
- Credit fatigue: users complain about top-up friction, want "just charge me monthly"
- Revenue unpredictability makes planning impossible
- Competitors win on subscription simplicity
- Unit economics require minimum commitment (credit amounts too small)
- Enterprise customers demand subscription for procurement reasons

**Early warning signs:**
- Low credit amounts dominating ($10 packs only)
- Users churning at top-up moment rather than continuing
- Feature requests for subscription option
- Sales conversations stalling on pricing model

## Review Schedule

**Next review:** 2025-04-01 (or after 100 paying users)

**Review questions:**
1. What's the average credit purchase amount?
2. What's the top-up cadence?
3. Are users complaining about the model?
4. How does churn compare to subscription competitors?
