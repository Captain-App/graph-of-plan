# SmartBox MVP

The foundational milestone. A working sandbox environment where AI agents can execute code safely.

## Scope

- Isolated execution environment on Cloudflare Workers
- Basic file system operations (read, write, list)
- Network access controls
- Session persistence via Durable Objects
- Basic API for agent integration

## Success Criteria

- Agent can execute Python/Node code in sandbox
- Files persist across sessions
- Network requests can be allowed/blocked per capability
- < 500ms cold start time

## What It Unlocks

This milestone is the foundation for everything else. Murphy, P4gent, and Nomos Cloud all depend on SmartBox infrastructure being operational.
