Port the Nomos domain system from Dart to TypeScript.

## Current State

Nomos is currently implemented in Dart with:
- Domain definitions as Dart classes
- Persistence via Firebase Firestore
- Backend logic in Cloud Functions for Firebase
- Code generation for Dart SDKs

## Target State

TypeScript implementation with:
- Domain definitions as TypeScript types
- Effect-TS for typed functional effects
- Persistence-agnostic core (can target multiple backends)
- Code generation for TypeScript SDKs, OpenAPI, MCP tools

## Why Migrate

1. **Team expertise**: More TypeScript than Dart experience
2. **Ecosystem**: Better tooling and library support in TypeScript
3. **Target platforms**: Cloudflare Workers runs JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Agent integration**: MCP and AI tooling is TypeScript-first
