**AI that can actually do things.**

Your AI assistant can send emails, update spreadsheets, and run reports — safely, with guardrails you control. You decide what it's allowed to do. It can't go rogue.

**The bitter lesson for everyone else.** Developers have repositories, filesystems, persistent context. SmartBoxes gives that same power to everyone—a personal environment where AI agents can do real work across all your systems.
