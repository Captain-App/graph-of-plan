# Client Projects Using Murphy

Number of real client projects actively using Murphy to manage their roadmap.

## Why This Metric

This is the leading indicator for the [client validation gate](/action-gate/client-roadmap-validation). When this number hits 1, we've proven:
- Murphy works for someone who didn't build it
- The planning-as-contract thesis is transferable
- The [chain-link](/diagnosis/chain-link-illegibility) strategy becomes legible

## What Counts

A project counts when:
- External client (not internal use)
- Real project with actual deliverables
- Murphy is the agreed source of truth for the roadmap
- Client actively references Murphy in project discussions
