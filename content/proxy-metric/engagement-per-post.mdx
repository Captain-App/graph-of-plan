# Engagement Per Post

Average meaningful engagement (saves, shares, substantive comments) per post.

## Why This Metric

Followers are a vanity metric. Engagement indicates content resonance and distribution potential. Engaged followers convert; passive followers don't.

## Current State

No baseline yet - establishing measurement system.

## Target

Average 25+ meaningful engagements per post over rolling 4-post window.

## What Counts

- Saves/bookmarks (intent to return)
- Shares/reposts (endorsement)
- Substantive comments (not just "great post!")
- Quote tweets with commentary
