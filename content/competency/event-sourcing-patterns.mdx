# Event Sourcing Patterns

We can design and implement event-sourced domain models with snapshot materialisation and audit trails.

## Evidence

This isn't a claimed capability - it's demonstrated by working code:

- **Nomos Dart** - Full event-sourcing implementation with domain models, event stores, and materialised views

## Why This Matters

Event sourcing provides:
- Complete audit trail of all state changes (critical for regulated industries)
- Ability to replay history and reconstruct past states
- Natural fit for AI observability (every action is an event)
- Time-travel debugging for complex workflows

## Depth of Knowledge

- Event store design and optimisation
- Snapshot materialisation strategies
- Projection patterns for read models
- Saga/process manager coordination
- CQRS separation for performance
