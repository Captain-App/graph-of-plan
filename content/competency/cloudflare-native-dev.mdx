# Cloudflare Native Development

We can build production-grade applications on Cloudflare's edge platform, using Workers, Durable Objects, D1, R2, and Queues effectively.

## Evidence

This isn't a claimed capability - it's demonstrated by working code:

- **Shipbox** - Full-stack application using Workers, Durable Objects for state, D1 for persistence
- **Sandbox MCP** - MCP server implementation running entirely on Cloudflare's edge

## Why This Matters

Cloudflare's edge platform enables:
- Global latency under 50ms for any user
- Serverless scale without cold start management
- Built-in isolation for multi-tenant workloads
- Cost structure that favours our usage patterns

## Depth of Knowledge

- Workers runtime constraints and workarounds
- Durable Object patterns for coordination
- D1 SQLite limitations and query patterns
- R2 streaming for large assets
- Queue-based background processing
