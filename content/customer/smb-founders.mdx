# SMB Founders & Operators

Small and medium business founders and operators run companies with 1-50 employees. They wear multiple hats, lack specialist staff, and make decisions based on immediate ROI.

## Segment Profile

### Size & Distribution

- **UK Market**: ~5.5 million SMBs
- **US Market**: ~33 million SMBs
- **Growth**: Relatively stable, 2-3% annual churn/creation
- **Addressable**: Tech-forward SMBs with £100k-£5M revenue

### Pain Points

**Time is the scarcest resource.** SMB founders work 50-70 hour weeks. Every hour spent on operations is an hour not spent on revenue generation.

**No specialist staff.** Large companies have procurement teams, IT departments, and project managers. SMBs have founders doing everything.

**Software overwhelm.** SMBs adopt tools reactively. The result is disconnected systems, duplicate data entry, and manual workarounds.

**Cash flow sensitivity.** SMBs can't absorb unexpected costs. Surprise bills, missed renewals at higher rates, and scope creep hit hard.

### Buying Behavior

- **Decision maker**: Founder or Operations Manager
- **Budget sensitivity**: High—must justify every £50/mo
- **Self-serve preference**: Avoid sales calls, prefer trial + upgrade
- **Time to value**: Must see benefit within first session
- **Churn risk**: Will cancel if value isn't immediately obvious

### Success Metrics

SMB founders measure tool value by:
- Time saved per week (hours)
- Money saved per month (£)
- Problems avoided (invoices caught, deadlines met)
- Complexity reduced (fewer tools, less manual work)
