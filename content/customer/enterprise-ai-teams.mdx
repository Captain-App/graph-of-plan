# Enterprise AI/ML Teams

Enterprise AI/ML teams are specialized groups within large organizations (500+ employees) responsible for developing, deploying, and governing AI systems. They operate under compliance requirements, procurement processes, and organizational complexity.

## Segment Profile

### Size & Distribution

- **Market**: ~15,000 enterprises globally with dedicated AI/ML teams
- **Team size**: 5-50 people per AI team
- **Growth**: 25% CAGR as enterprises accelerate AI adoption
- **Addressable**: Enterprises deploying autonomous agents in production

### Pain Points

**Governance gaps are career risk.** When an AI system makes a decision that affects customers or operations, someone is accountable. Enterprise AI teams need audit trails that satisfy legal, compliance, and executive scrutiny.

**Tool sprawl creates blind spots.** Large organizations run multiple AI initiatives across different teams. Without centralized visibility, governance becomes impossible.

**Procurement is slow.** Enterprise buying cycles are 3-12 months. Tools need security reviews, legal approval, and budget allocation across fiscal years.

**Build vs. buy tension.** AI teams can build internal tooling, but it diverts resources from core AI development. Commercial tools must offer substantial time savings.

### Buying Behavior

- **Decision maker**: VP of AI/ML, Head of Data Science, or CISO
- **Influencer**: Individual contributors who evaluate technical fit
- **Procurement**: Legal, Security, Procurement must all approve
- **Budget**: £25k-£250k ACV range for infrastructure tools
- **Sales cycle**: 3-6 months with POC/pilot phase
- **Reference required**: Will call existing customers
