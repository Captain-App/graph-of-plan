# Solopreneurs & Freelancers

Solopreneurs and freelancers are individuals running their own businesses—consultants, content creators, designers, developers, and other skilled professionals who work independently.

## Segment Profile

### Size & Distribution

- **UK Market**: ~4.3 million self-employed individuals
- **US Market**: ~16 million self-employed individuals
- **Growth**: 5% CAGR driven by remote work and gig economy
- **Addressable**: Tech-comfortable solopreneurs with £30k+ annual revenue

### Pain Points

**Every hour counts.** Solopreneurs don't have colleagues to delegate to. Administrative tasks directly compete with billable work.

**Price sensitivity is extreme.** With variable income and no corporate budget, every subscription must justify itself monthly. Many solopreneurs audit subscriptions annually and cut aggressively.

**Feast or famine cash flow.** Income is lumpy. Solopreneurs need to optimize costs during slow periods but can't afford tools that take months to deliver value.

**Isolation.** No team means no one to catch mistakes, remind about renewals, or spot inefficiencies. Solopreneurs need tools that act as a second pair of eyes.

### Buying Behavior

- **Decision maker**: The solopreneur (no procurement process)
- **Budget**: £0-50/mo for individual tools, rarely more
- **Trial requirement**: Must offer free tier or generous trial
- **Instant value**: If it doesn't help in the first session, it's gone
- **Word of mouth**: Trust peer recommendations over marketing

### Success Metrics

Solopreneurs measure tool value by:
- Time saved per week (converted to billable hours)
- Money saved per month
- Mental load reduced
- Problems caught before they become emergencies
