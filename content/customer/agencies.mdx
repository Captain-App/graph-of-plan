# Digital Agencies & Consultancies

Digital agencies and consultancies are service businesses that deliver projects for clients. They operate on fixed budgets, tight timelines, and reputation-dependent revenue streams.

## Segment Profile

### Size & Distribution

- **UK Market**: ~25,000 digital agencies (< 50 employees avg)
- **US Market**: ~50,000 digital agencies
- **Growth**: 8% CAGR driven by digital transformation budgets
- **Addressable**: Agencies with 5-50 staff and £500k-£5M annual revenue

### Pain Points

**Delivery risk is existential.** A missed deadline damages client relationships, triggers penalty clauses, and creates costly overtime. Agencies absorb this risk personally—there's no enterprise buffer.

**Tool fatigue is real.** The average agency uses 15+ SaaS tools. Each new tool requires training, integration, and ongoing maintenance. Agencies are skeptical of "yet another platform."

**Margins are thin.** Typical agency gross margins are 40-60%. Any efficiency gain drops directly to the bottom line.

**Talent is expensive.** Senior developers cost £60-100k/year. Agencies can't afford idle time, but they also can't afford to miss specialist skills.

### Buying Behavior

- **Decision maker**: Operations Director, Delivery Lead, or Founder
- **Budget owner**: Often the same person (small orgs)
- **Procurement cycle**: 2-4 weeks for tools under £500/mo
- **Trial requirement**: Must see value before committing
- **Reference dependent**: Ask peers before buying

### Success Metrics

Agencies measure tool value by:
- Hours saved per project
- Delivery accuracy improvement
- Client satisfaction scores
- Margin protection
