# Snapshot materialisation

Snapshot materialisation is the ability to capture and restore the complete state of an execution environment at any point in time.

This primitive enables:

- **Reproducibility**: Any previous state can be recreated exactly
- **Branching**: Multiple execution paths can diverge from a common snapshot
- **Recovery**: Failed operations can roll back to known-good states
- **Auditing**: Complete history of state changes is preserved

For agents, this means they can experiment freely knowing that any mistake is reversible. The cost of failure approaches zero.
