# Capability-scoped sandbox execution

Capability-scoped execution restricts what an agent can do based on explicit, fine-grained permissions rather than coarse access controls.

Key properties:

- **Least privilege by default**: Agents start with no permissions
- **Explicit grants**: Each capability must be explicitly granted
- **Auditable boundaries**: Every permission grant is logged
- **Revocable**: Capabilities can be withdrawn at any time

This model mirrors capability-based security systems but applied to agent execution contexts. An agent cannot access a file, network endpoint, or API unless that specific capability has been granted to its execution context.
