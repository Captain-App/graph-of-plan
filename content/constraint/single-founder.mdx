# Single Founder

One person building four products. Limited bandwidth, high context-switching cost.

## Impact

Can't parallelise across products. Can't be in sales calls while shipping code. Support burden scales with users while development capacity doesn't. No coverage for illness or vacation.

## Why This Is Hard

Hiring too early burns runway. Hiring wrong burns more. Solo founder companies have higher failure rates. Investor bias against single founders makes fundraising harder.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Sequential focus** - Ship one product at a time rather than all in parallel
2. **Shared infrastructure** - Build capabilities that serve multiple products
3. **AI assistance** - Use AI tools to get more done per hour
4. **Design partners over users** - Fewer, deeper relationships require less support bandwidth
