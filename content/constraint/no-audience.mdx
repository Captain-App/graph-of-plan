# No Audience

We have no existing followers, newsletter subscribers, or community. Zero distribution.

## Impact

Every customer acquisition will require paid advertising, cold outreach, or earned media. There's no existing trust reservoir to draw from. Product launches can't rely on "launch day traffic" from an audience.

## Why This Is Hard

Building audience takes years of consistent content. Shortcuts (buying followers, viral hacks) don't create purchasing intent. The compounding returns of audience-building mean starting late is costly.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Build in public** - Document the journey to create content naturally
2. **Technical content** - Write about problems we solve (attracts potential customers)
3. **Community participation** - Engage in existing communities rather than building from scratch
4. **Design partners** - Replace audience with deep relationships with few early users
