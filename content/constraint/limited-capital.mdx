# Limited Capital

Bootstrap stage with personal savings. Cannot outspend competition or buy market share.

## Impact

No paid user acquisition at scale. No enterprise sales team. No buffer for extended development cycles. Must reach profitability faster than funded competitors.

## Why This Is Soft

Unlike the other constraints, capital can change. Product-market fit unlocks revenue. Revenue enables hiring. Revenue or traction enables fundraising. This constraint relaxes as the business grows.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Revenue focus** - Prioritise products with clearer paths to payment
2. **Low marginal costs** - Use serverless and usage-based infrastructure
3. **Efficient GTM** - Content marketing over paid acquisition
4. **Self-funding milestone** - Target £100K MRR before considering external capital
