description: Product launch order and why

# Go-to-Market Sequencing

We're building four products on shared infrastructure. The order we launch them matters.

## Why the Order Matters

1. **Dependencies**: Some products need others to exist first
2. **Learning**: Each product teaches us something useful for the next
3. **Cash flow**: Revenue from early products funds later ones
4. **Hedging**: If product A fails, products B/C/D might still work

## Launch Sequence

### Phase 1 (M0-M3): SmartBoxes First

**Why SmartBoxes leads:**

SmartBoxes is both a product and our internal development tool. By shipping SmartBoxes first:
- We dogfood our own infrastructure
- We prove the Cloudflare-native execution model
- We create a distribution channel for capability packs
- We generate revenue to fund other products

**Phase 1 milestones:**

| Month | SmartBoxes | Infrastructure |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| M0 | Dashboard MVP, auth, billing | Core sandbox runtime |
| M1 | Capability system, 3-5 packs | Nomos integration |
| M2 | Deploy service (CF Pages/Workers) | Usage metering |
| M3 | Capability marketplace | Multi-tenant isolation |

**Phase 1 targets:**
- 200+ active SmartBox users
- £5K MRR
- 10+ capability packs
- Proven Cloudflare cost model

### Phase 2 (M3-M6): Murphy + P4gent (Prove Applications)

**Why Murphy and P4gent together:**

Both products are applications built on SmartBoxes + Nomos. Launching them in parallel:
- Proves the platform can support diverse use cases
- Tests two different GTM motions (B2B vs. B2C)
- Creates cross-sell opportunities in both directions

**Murphy focus (B2B):**
- Agency wedge with delivery pain
- Higher ACV, longer sales cycle
- Reference customers for enterprise push

**P4gent focus (B2C):**
- Consumer distribution via social
- Lower ACV, self-serve motion
- Volume to validate unit economics

**Phase 2 milestones:**

| Month | Murphy | P4gent |
|-------|--------|--------|
| M3 | Design partners (5-10) | Core loop MVP |
| M4 | First paying teams | Integrations (Xero, email) |
| M5 | Case studies | Intelligence features |
| M6 | Enterprise pilot | Communication drafts |

**Phase 2 targets:**
- Murphy: 15+ paying teams, £9K MRR
- P4gent: 100+ subscribers, £2K MRR
- 3 public case studies
- Proven platform reuse

### Phase 3 (M6-M12): Nomos Cloud Public

**Why Nomos Cloud launches last:**

Nomos Cloud is infrastructure for other AI builders. It needs:
- Proven reliability (months of internal use)
- Reference implementations (SmartBoxes, Murphy, P4gent)
- Enterprise credibility (SOC 2 in progress)

**Phase 3 sequence:**

| Month | Nomos Cloud | Enterprise |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| M6 | Public beta, free tier | Security documentation |
| M7 | Usage-based billing | First enterprise pilot |
| M8 | Dashboard MVP | SOC 2 audit begins |
| M9 | Query API, story rendering | Enterprise contracts |
| M10 | Framework integrations | Partner channel |
| M12 | SOC 2 certified | 5+ enterprise logos |

**Phase 3 targets:**
- 300+ Nomos Cloud customers
- £50K MRR from usage
- 5+ enterprise contracts
- SOC 2 Type II certified

## Cross-Sell (Hopefully)

The products share infrastructure, so customers of one might want others. This is optimistic but plausible:

### SmartBoxes → Nomos Cloud

SmartBoxes users who build AI tools might need audit trails for production:
1. User builds AI tool in SmartBox
2. Tool needs production governance
3. User adds Nomos Cloud for audit trails

**Hope**: 10% of SmartBoxes users add Nomos Cloud

### Murphy/P4gent → SmartBoxes

Users who see Murphy or P4gent working might want similar tools:
1. Agency uses Murphy for delivery
2. Agency wants custom AI tools for clients
3. Agency adopts SmartBoxes for client work

**Hope**: 20% of Murphy/P4gent users try SmartBoxes

### Nomos Cloud → SmartBoxes

Enterprise customers buying Nomos might want sandboxed execution too:
1. Enterprise buys Nomos Cloud for compliance
2. Enterprise wants sandboxed execution
3. Enterprise adds SmartBoxes

**Hope**: 50% of Nomos Cloud enterprise add SmartBoxes

These conversion rates are guesses. They might be wildly optimistic.

## Revenue Mix Evolution

### Year 1 Mix

```
M3:   SmartBoxes 100%
M6:   SmartBoxes 60%, Murphy 30%, P4gent 10%
M9:   SmartBoxes 40%, Murphy 25%, P4gent 10%, Nomos 25%
M12:  SmartBoxes 30%, Murphy 20%, P4gent 5%, Nomos 45%
```

### Year 2 Target Mix

```
SmartBoxes: 25% (volume, lower ARPU)
Murphy: 15% (mid-market teams)
P4gent: 5% (consumer, high churn)
Nomos Cloud: 55% (enterprise, high ACV)
```

**Why Nomos dominates long-term:**
- Highest ARPU (£150 usage + £25K enterprise ACV)
- Best gross margins (90%)
- Strongest moat (compliance certifications)
- Network effects (more agents = more entries = more value)

## Risk Mitigation

### What if SmartBoxes doesn't work?

If SmartBoxes fails to find product-market fit:
- Murphy and P4gent can still launch (just more expensive to build)
- Nomos Cloud can target external agent builders
- We lose the cross-sell loop but retain viable products

### What if Nomos Cloud doesn't work?

If Nomos Cloud fails to gain enterprise traction:
- SmartBoxes and Murphy continue with internal audit
- P4gent is unaffected
- We lose the highest-margin product but retain consumer/SMB business

### What if everything works?

If all four products hit targets:
- £100K MRR by end of Year 1 (base case)
- £200K+ MRR by end of Year 1 (optimistic case)
- Cross-sell between products working
- Sustainable business with room to grow

This is the happy path. Things rarely go this smoothly.

## Capital Allocation

### M0-M3 (Seed/Bootstrap)

| Category | Allocation | Focus |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Engineering | 70% | SmartBoxes core |
| Marketing | 15% | Content, developer advocacy |
| Operations | 15% | Infrastructure, support |

### M3-M6 (Post-Revenue)

| Category | Allocation | Focus |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Engineering | 60% | Murphy + P4gent |
| Marketing | 25% | Agency GTM, consumer ads |
| Operations | 15% | Customer success |

### M6-M12 (Growth)

| Category | Allocation | Focus |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Engineering | 50% | Nomos Cloud, platform |
| Marketing | 30% | Enterprise sales, brand |
| Operations | 20% | Compliance, support |

## Key Decisions

### Why not launch Nomos Cloud first?

- No internal proof points
- No reference customers
- Enterprise sales cycle is 6+ months
- Would burn cash before revenue

### Why not focus on one product?

- Shared infrastructure means marginal cost of additional products is low
- Multiple products de-risk total failure
- Cross-sell creates compounding growth
- Different products serve different market signals

### Why this specific sequence?

- Infrastructure → Applications → Platform is the natural dependency order
- B2B + B2C in parallel tests different GTM motions
- Platform last means we have proof points when we sell to other builders
