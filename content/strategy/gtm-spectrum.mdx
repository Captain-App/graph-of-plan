# GTM Strategy Spectrum

Software businesses distribute their products across a spectrum of go-to-market models. Each position on the spectrum trades off different things: reach vs. revenue, scale vs. margins, speed vs. stickiness.

## The Spectrum

```
FREE/OSS ←——————————————————————————————————————————————→ BESPOKE
   │                        │                        │
   │                        │                        │
Open Source          SaaS/Self-Serve           Custom Build
Freemium             Sales-Led SaaS            Consulting
Developer Tools      PLG → Sales               System Integrator
                     Usage-Based               Agency Model
```

### 1. Open Source / Freemium (Left End)

**Model**: Give away the core product. Monetise through:
- Hosted/managed versions (GitLab, Elastic)
- Enterprise features (Redis, MongoDB)
- Support and services (Red Hat)
- Complementary products (Vercel/Next.js)

**Tradeoffs**:
| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Maximum distribution | Zero direct revenue from most users |
| Community contributions | Support burden without payment |
| Developer trust | Competitors can fork your work |
| Hiring pipeline | Must find adjacent monetisation |

**Tends to work when**: Strong network effects, developer-first product, complementary revenue streams exist, category creation needed.

**Historical examples**:
- **MySQL** (1995) → Acquired by Sun for $1B, then Oracle
- **Linux** (1991) → Red Hat IPO'd at $3.6B (1999), acquired by IBM for $34B (2019)
- **MongoDB** (2007) → IPO at $1.2B (2017), peaked at $40B (2021)

### 2. Product-Led Growth / Self-Serve SaaS (Middle-Left)

**Model**: Free tier or trial, self-serve upgrade, expand within accounts.

**Tradeoffs**:
| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Low CAC through virality | High churn on low tiers |
| Scales without sales team | Revenue per user is low |
| Usage data informs product | Support costs at scale |
| Fast iteration cycles | Hard to move upmarket |

**Tends to work when**: Product is simple enough to try alone, value is obvious quickly, natural expansion within teams/companies.

**The PLG playbook**:
1. **Land**: Free tier or trial, no sales touch
2. **Expand**: Usage grows, team invites, features gate
3. **Monetise**: Convert to paid when value proven
4. **Enterprise**: Sales assists large deals

**Historical evolution**:
- **1999-2005**: SaaS emerges (Salesforce). Still sales-led.
- **2006-2012**: Freemium rises (Dropbox, Slack). "Try before buy."
- **2013-2018**: PLG formalised (Atlassian, Zoom). Sales-assisted at scale.
- **2019-present**: PLG expected for developer tools. Enterprise adds sales layer.

### 3. Sales-Led SaaS (Middle)

**Model**: Marketing generates leads, sales closes deals, success retains.

**Tradeoffs**:
| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Higher ACV | High CAC (sales cost) |
| Multi-year contracts | Long sales cycles |
| Predictable revenue | Harder to iterate quickly |
| Deep customer relationships | Scales linearly with headcount |

**Tends to work when**: Complex products needing explanation, high ACV justifies sales cost, buyers aren't users (procurement), compliance/security requirements.

**The traditional SaaS metrics**:
- **CAC Payback**: Months to recover customer acquisition cost
- **LTV:CAC**: Lifetime value vs. acquisition cost (target: 3:1+)
- **Magic Number**: Revenue growth efficiency
- **Net Revenue Retention**: Expansion - Churn (target: >100%)

**Historical context**:
- **Salesforce** (1999) launched "No Software" - the original SaaS positioning
- **Workday** (2005) proved enterprise SaaS works for mission-critical systems
- **ServiceNow** (2003) showed IT buyers would adopt cloud
- By 2020, SaaS became the default; on-premise is now the exception

### 4. Usage-Based Pricing (Middle-Right)

**Model**: Charge based on consumption rather than seats or features.

**Tradeoffs**:
| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Aligns price with value | Revenue is variable/unpredictable |
| Land easily, expand naturally | Customers optimise usage down |
| Fair for small/large customers | Harder to forecast |
| Transparent pricing | Billing complexity |

**Tends to work when**: Usage correlates with value, customers vary widely in scale, API/infrastructure products, metering is straightforward.

**The usage-based wave**:
- **AWS** (2006) proved consumption pricing at scale
- **Twilio** (2008) brought it to APIs
- **Stripe** (2010) applied it to payments
- **Snowflake** (2012) used it for data warehousing
- **OpenAI** (2022) made it standard for AI APIs

### 5. Enterprise / Custom / Bespoke (Right End)

**Model**: Build specifically for one customer's needs. High-touch, high-margin.

**Tradeoffs**:
| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Very high revenue per customer | Doesn't scale |
| Deep product insight | Risk of building wrong things |
| Strong relationships | Customer concentration risk |
| High margins per deal | Opportunity cost of time |

**Tends to work when**: Early stage needing revenue, complex integration requirements, learning what to build, establishing reference customers.

**The "do things that don't scale" argument**:

Paul Graham's [famous essay](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) argues startups should start with bespoke, manual, high-touch approaches before scaling. Applied to GTM:

1. **Find one customer who desperately needs you**
2. **Build exactly what they need, even manually**
3. **Extract the pattern that generalises**
4. **Then automate and scale**

**Historical patterns**:
- **Palantir** started with bespoke government contracts, later productised
- **Stripe** did custom integrations for YC startups before self-serve
- **Slack** was built as internal tool for one company (Tiny Speck)

## A Brief History of SaaS

### The Pre-SaaS Era (1960s-1999)

**Mainframe timesharing** (1960s): Multiple users shared expensive mainframe resources. Arguably the first "cloud" model.

**ASPs** (1990s): Application Service Providers hosted software for customers. Failed due to:
- Single-tenant architecture (expensive)
- Slow internet (poor UX)
- No self-service (high touch)

### SaaS 1.0: The Salesforce Era (1999-2010)

**Salesforce** launched in 1999 with "No Software" positioning:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Subscription billing
- Delivered via browser
- Still sales-led, but simpler procurement

**Key innovations**:
- Multi-tenancy reduced hosting costs
- AppExchange created ecosystem (2005)
- Force.com enabled platform extensibility (2007)

### SaaS 2.0: Freemium & Consumerisation (2006-2015)

**Dropbox** (2007) proved consumer-grade UX sells enterprise:
- Viral growth via referrals
- IT departments bought what employees already used
- "Shadow IT" became a feature, not a bug

**Slack** (2013) perfected bottom-up adoption:
- Free tier for teams
- Self-serve upgrade
- Enterprise sales layer added later

### SaaS 3.0: Product-Led Everything (2015-2022)

**Atlassian** IPO'd (2015) with no sales team, proving PLG at scale.

**Zoom** (2011-2020) showed PLG works for video too:
- Free tier sufficient for most users
- Quality differentiation drove word-of-mouth
- Enterprise features justified premium pricing

### SaaS 4.0: AI-Native (2022-Present)

**OpenAI** and **Anthropic** introduced new patterns:
- Usage-based pricing by tokens/compute
- API-first with consumer wrappers
- Model improvements as product updates
- Inference costs as primary COGS

**Emerging questions**:
- How do AI wrappers differentiate?
- Does usage-based work when costs drop exponentially?
- What's the moat when the model isn't yours?

## Where We Sit

Captain App's products span the spectrum:

| Product | GTM Model | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **SmartBoxes** | PLG → Sales | Self-serve for individuals, sales for teams |
| **P4gent** | Freemium/PLG | Consumer product, low ACV, viral potential |
| **Murphy** | Sales-assisted PLG | Agency deals need relationships |
| **Nomos Cloud** | Usage-based + Enterprise | API product with enterprise overlay |

### Our Bet

We're betting on **"land with PLG, expand with sales"**:

1. Products must be usable without talking to anyone
2. Free tier proves value before payment
3. Sales engages for team/enterprise expansion
4. Usage-based pricing aligns costs with value

This is the [Atlassian model](https://www.atlassian.com/company/history), updated for AI infrastructure.

### What We're Not Doing

**Not pure OSS**: We don't have the runway to give everything away and hope for monetisation later.

**Not bespoke consulting**: We don't have the team to do custom builds for individual customers (though we will do "design partner" work to learn).

**Not pure enterprise sales**: We don't have 12-month sales cycles worth of runway.
