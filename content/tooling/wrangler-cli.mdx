# Wrangler CLI

Cloudflare's command-line tool for developing and deploying Workers.

## What It Is

Wrangler is the official CLI for Cloudflare Workers, providing local development, testing, and deployment capabilities. It handles the entire development lifecycle from scaffolding new projects to deploying to production.

## How We Use It

Wrangler is the primary deployment and development tool for all Cloudflare-hosted services:

- **Local development**: `wrangler dev` provides a local development server with hot reload
- **Deployment**: `wrangler deploy` pushes code to Cloudflare's edge network
- **Database management**: `wrangler d1` commands for D1 database operations
- **Storage**: `wrangler r2` for R2 bucket management
- **Pages**: `wrangler pages` for static site deployments

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Start local development server
wrangler dev

# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy

# Run D1 migrations
wrangler d1 migrations apply production

# Tail production logs
wrangler tail
```

## Why It Matters

Wrangler provides a consistent interface across all Cloudflare primitives. It enables local development that closely mirrors production behavior, reducing the gap between development and deployment environments.
