# Cloudflare Workflows

Durable execution for long-running processes.

## What It Is

Workflows enable long-running, stateful processes that can pause and resume. They survive failures and can run for hours or days.

## How We Use It

Workflows orchestrate complex operations:

- **Multi-step derivations**: Complex Nomos event processing
- **Deployment pipelines**: Building and deploying user projects
- **Scheduled tasks**: Recurring maintenance and cleanup
- **Saga patterns**: Multi-service transactions with compensation

## Why It Matters

Workflows let us build reliable long-running processes without managing job queues, schedulers, or state machines ourselves.
