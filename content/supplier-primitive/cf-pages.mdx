# Cloudflare Pages

Static site hosting with integrated CI/CD.

## What It Is

Pages hosts static sites on Cloudflare's global network. It includes git integration, preview deployments, and custom domain support.

## How We Use It

Pages powers user deployments:

- **SmartBox deployments**: When agents build websites, they deploy to Pages
- **Static assets**: Hosting compiled frontends and documentation
- **Preview URLs**: Every deployment gets a unique URL for testing

## Why It Matters

Pages provides zero-config deployment for static sites. Agents can deploy user projects without complex infrastructure setup.
