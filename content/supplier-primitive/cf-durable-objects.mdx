# Cloudflare Durable Objects

Stateful serverless compute with strong consistency.

## What It Is

Durable Objects provide single-threaded, strongly consistent compute with persistent storage. Each object has a unique ID and runs in a single location, enabling coordination and state management without distributed systems complexity.

## How We Use It

Durable Objects are central to our architecture:

- **Per-sandbox state**: Each SmartBox is backed by a Durable Object
- **Per-timeline sequencing**: Nomos uses Durable Objects for ordered event streams
- **Session management**: User sessions and workspace coordination
- **Real-time features**: WebSocket connections and live updates

## Why It Matters

Durable Objects solve the hardest problems in distributed systems—coordination and consistency—without requiring us to build or operate distributed databases.
