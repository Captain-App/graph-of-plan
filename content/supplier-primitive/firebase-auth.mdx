# Firebase Authentication

Identity and access management.

## What It Is

Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users. It supports email/password, phone, and federated identity providers (Google, Apple, GitHub, etc.).

## How We Use It

Firebase Auth handles identity in `nomos_persistence`:

- **User authentication**: Sign-in flows for Nomos clients
- **Token verification**: Validating requests in Cloud Functions
- **Security rules**: Firestore access control based on auth state
- **Multi-tenancy**: Workspace isolation via custom claims

## Cloudflare Equivalent

In the Cloudflare stack, authentication is handled by custom Workers code or third-party providers. Cloudflare Access provides similar functionality for enterprise deployments.

## Why It Matters

Firebase Auth provides a complete authentication solution out of the box. Teams already using Firebase Auth can integrate Nomos without adding another identity provider.
