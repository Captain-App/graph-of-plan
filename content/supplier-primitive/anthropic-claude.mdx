# Claude API

Anthropic's Claude model API for AI reasoning.

## What It Is

The Claude API provides access to Anthropic's Claude models for text generation, analysis, and tool use. It supports extended context windows, streaming, and native function calling.

## How We Use It

Claude powers all AI capabilities:

- **SmartBoxes**: Claude as the coding agent, executing tasks autonomously
- **Murphy**: Claude for delivery analysis, constraint identification, and intervention recommendations
- **P4gent**: Claude for long-running agent workflows with tool use
- **Nomos**: Claude for story rendering from audit trails

## Why It Matters

Claude's combination of capability, safety, and tool use support makes it ideal for autonomous agent workloads. The model's understanding of code, business context, and safety constraints aligns with our platform's goals.
