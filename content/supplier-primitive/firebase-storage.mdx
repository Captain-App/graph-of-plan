# Cloud Storage for Firebase

Object storage for files and blobs.

## What It Is

Cloud Storage for Firebase provides scalable object storage backed by Google Cloud Storage. It includes Firebase SDK integration for easy uploads and downloads from client apps.

## How We Use It

Cloud Storage handles large artifacts in `nomos_persistence`:

- **Blob storage**: Large event payloads and attachments
- **Immutable ledgers**: Archived event data
- **Exports**: Backup and export files
- **Assets**: User-uploaded content

## Cloudflare Equivalent

In the Cloudflare stack, this role is filled by **R2** (S3-compatible object storage).

## Why It Matters

Cloud Storage provides reliable, scalable blob storage with Firebase SDK integration. Direct client uploads reduce server load for file-heavy workloads.
