# Cloudflare D1

SQLite at the edge.

## What It Is

D1 is a serverless SQL database built on SQLite. It runs at the edge, close to Workers, with automatic replication and scaling.

## How We Use It

D1 handles structured data queries:

- **Index storage**: Query indexes for Nomos event streams
- **Metadata**: User accounts, billing, and configuration
- **Search**: Fast lookups by various dimensions
- **Analytics**: Aggregated usage data

## Why It Matters

SQLite's simplicity combined with edge distribution means fast queries without managing database infrastructure. The familiar SQL interface makes development straightforward.
