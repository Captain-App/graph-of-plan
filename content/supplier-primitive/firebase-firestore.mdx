# Cloud Firestore

NoSQL document database with real-time sync.

## What It Is

Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database. It supports real-time listeners, offline persistence, and automatic multi-region replication.

## How We Use It

Firestore backs the `nomos_persistence` packages:

- **Event collections**: Storing Nomos event streams as documents
- **Index storage**: Query indexes for fast lookups
- **Real-time sync**: Live updates for connected clients
- **Offline mode**: Local persistence when disconnected

## Cloudflare Equivalent

In the Cloudflare stack, this role is filled by:
- **Durable Objects** for per-entity state and coordination
- **D1** for structured queries
- **R2** for larger document storage

## Why It Matters

Firestore provides a proven, scalable document database with excellent developer experience. Teams already using Firebase can deploy Nomos without adopting new infrastructure.
