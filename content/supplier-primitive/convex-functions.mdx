Convex Functions: serverless compute tightly integrated with Convex Database.

## Features

- Queries: Read-only functions with automatic caching
- Mutations: Transactional writes
- Actions: Side effects (external APIs, file processing)
- Scheduled functions: Cron-like scheduling
- HTTP endpoints: REST API exposure

## Comparison to Cloud Functions

- Tighter database integration (no cold start for DB access)
- Automatic retries and exactly-once semantics
- TypeScript-only (no other languages)
- No edge deployment (runs in Convex infrastructure)
