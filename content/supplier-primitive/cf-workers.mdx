# Cloudflare Workers

Serverless JavaScript/TypeScript execution at the edge.

## What It Is

Workers are serverless functions that run on Cloudflare's global network. Code executes within milliseconds of users, with no cold starts and automatic scaling.

## How We Use It

Workers handle all HTTP traffic in our platform:

- API endpoints for SmartBoxes, Nomos Cloud, and Murphy
- Request routing and authentication
- Lightweight compute for fast operations
- Integration point for other Cloudflare primitives

## Why It Matters

Workers eliminate traditional server infrastructure. We don't manage EC2 instances, Kubernetes clusters, or load balancers. The platform scales automatically from zero to millions of requests.
