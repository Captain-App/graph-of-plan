# Cloudflare Queues

Serverless message queues.

## What It Is

Queues provide reliable, at-least-once message delivery between Workers. Messages are persisted and retried automatically on failure.

## How We Use It

Queues handle async processing:

- **Event indexing**: Background processing of Nomos events
- **Notifications**: Delivery of alerts and webhooks
- **Heavy compute**: Offloading expensive operations from request path
- **Integration**: Connecting to external systems asynchronously

## Why It Matters

Queues decouple request handling from heavy processing, keeping APIs fast while ensuring work gets done reliably.
