# Cloudflare R2

S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees.

## What It Is

R2 is object storage that's API-compatible with S3 but without egress charges. It integrates directly with Workers for fast access from serverless functions.

## How We Use It

R2 stores all persistent data in our platform:

- **Sandbox filesystems**: Files created and modified in SmartBoxes
- **Immutable ledgers**: Nomos event storage for audit trails
- **Artifacts**: Build outputs, deployments, and assets
- **Backups**: Snapshot storage for sandbox state

## Why It Matters

Zero egress fees mean we can serve content globally without cost anxiety. Direct Worker integration means fast access without network hops.
