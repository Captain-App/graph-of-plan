## What It Is

The Twilio WhatsApp Business API provides programmatic access to WhatsApp's messaging platform. It supports text messages, media, interactive buttons, and template messages for notifications.

## How We Use It

WhatsApp becomes an interface for SmartBox interaction:

- **Conversational control**: Send commands to your SmartBox via WhatsApp
- **Status updates**: Receive deployment notifications and alerts
- **Approval workflows**: Approve or reject actions with quick reply buttons
- **File sharing**: Send and receive files, screenshots, and logs

## Why It Matters

WhatsApp is where people already are. With 2+ billion users, it's the most accessible interface for AI agent interaction—no app to install, no dashboard to learn. Just text your SmartBox like you'd text a teammate.
