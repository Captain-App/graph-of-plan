# Supplier concentration: Cloudflare/Anthropic dependency

Our entire platform runs on two suppliers: Cloudflare (compute/storage) and Anthropic (AI). Concentration creates fragility.

## The Risk

The architecture is elegant but concentrated:

- **Cloudflare**: Workers, Durable Objects, R2, D1, Queues, Workflows, Pages—all compute and storage
- **Anthropic**: Claude API for all AI reasoning across all products

If either supplier has issues—outages, pricing changes, policy changes, or business failure—we have limited fallback options.

## Specific Threats

### Cloudflare

1. **Outages**: Global Cloudflare outages would take all products offline
2. **Pricing changes**: Edge compute pricing could increase significantly
3. **Feature deprecation**: Durable Objects or Workflows could be retired
4. **Policy enforcement**: Our workloads could be flagged by abuse detection
5. **Acquisition/pivot**: Cloudflare could be acquired or change strategic direction

### Anthropic

1. **API outages**: Claude unavailability breaks all AI-dependent features
2. **Model retirement**: Versions we depend on could be deprecated
3. **Pricing increases**: Cost per token could rise beyond our margins
4. **Policy restrictions**: New acceptable use policies could exclude our use cases
5. **Company risk**: Anthropic is a startup; funding or acquisition could change availability

## Mitigations

### Technical

- **Multi-region deployment**: Cloudflare's global network provides inherent redundancy
- **Graceful degradation**: Products should fail gracefully when dependencies are unavailable
- **Abstraction layers**: AI calls go through our abstraction, not directly to Anthropic
- **Multi-model support**: Architecture supports swapping to OpenAI, Google, or local models

### Business

- **Relationship management**: Direct relationships with both suppliers, not just API access
- **Cost monitoring**: Alert if supplier costs drift from budget assumptions
- **Alternative evaluation**: Quarterly review of alternative providers
- **Financial reserves**: Maintain runway buffer for supplier transitions if needed

### Contractual

- **SLAs**: Enterprise agreements with uptime commitments where available
- **Pricing locks**: Negotiate committed-use discounts that lock in pricing
- **Notice periods**: Ensure deprecation notices give adequate migration time

## Residual Risk

True multi-cloud is expensive and complex. For a startup, concentration is pragmatic—it lets us move fast. The risk is real but acceptable given our stage. As we scale, diversification becomes more important.

**Probability**: Low-Medium (both suppliers are stable; total failure unlikely)
**Impact**: Critical (could require platform rebuild)
**Mitigation effectiveness**: Moderate (fallbacks exist but would be painful)
