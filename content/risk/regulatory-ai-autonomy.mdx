# Regulatory: AI autonomy rules tightening

Governments worldwide are developing AI regulation. Rules restricting autonomous agent actions could limit what our products can do.

## The Risk

Our products give AI agents real capabilities:

- **SmartBoxes** lets agents execute code, deploy websites, and access external APIs
- **Murphy** enables agents to monitor and report on project status automatically
- **P4gent** allows agents to draft and suggest communications on users' behalf

Regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act, potential US federal AI legislation, and sector-specific rules (financial services, healthcare) could impose requirements that limit these capabilities or make them prohibitively expensive to operate.

## Specific Threats

1. **Disclosure requirements**: Mandatory labeling of AI-generated content
2. **Human-in-the-loop mandates**: Regulations requiring human approval before certain AI actions
3. **Sector bans**: Prohibition of autonomous AI in specific industries (finance, healthcare, legal)
4. **Liability frameworks**: New liability rules that make operating autonomous agents uninsurable
5. **Data residency**: Requirements that AI processing happen within specific jurisdictions

## Mitigations

### Product Design

- **Human-in-the-loop by default**: P4gent already requires human approval before sending communications. SmartBoxes has explicit risk acceptance.
- **Audit trails**: Nomos Cloud provides complete decision traces that satisfy explainability requirements.
- **Configurable autonomy**: Products allow organisations to dial down autonomy to meet their compliance needs.

### Business

- **Regulatory monitoring**: Track AI legislation across target markets (UK, EU, US)
- **Compliance partnerships**: Work with legal and compliance consultants who specialise in AI
- **Industry engagement**: Participate in standards bodies and comment on proposed regulations
- **Market flexibility**: B2B focus means we can adapt to enterprise compliance requirements

## Residual Risk

Regulation is inherently unpredictable. A strict interpretation of "autonomous AI" could require significant product changes. Our best protection is building products that already exceed likely requirements—full auditability, human oversight, and configurable autonomy levels.

**Probability**: High (AI regulation is coming; severity is uncertain)
**Impact**: Medium-High (could require product changes, but unlikely to be existential)
**Mitigation effectiveness**: Good (we're building compliance-first)
