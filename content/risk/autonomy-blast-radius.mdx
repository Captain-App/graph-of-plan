# Autonomy increases blast radius

As agents gain more autonomy, the potential impact of their mistakes grows proportionally.

An agent with broad file system access can delete critical data. An agent with network access can exfiltrate information. An agent with execution privileges can run arbitrary code.

This is the fundamental tension in agent systems: **capability enables productivity, but also enables harm**.

The mitigation is not to restrict autonomy—that defeats the purpose of agents. Instead, we must ensure that:

1. Autonomy is always scoped to the minimum necessary
2. State changes are reversible
3. Damage is contained to well-defined boundaries
4. Human oversight remains possible at critical junctures

Capability-scoped execution addresses this by making blast radius explicitly configurable per execution context.
