# Execution: One team, many products

We're building four products with a small team. Spreading too thin could result in none of them reaching product-market fit.

## The Risk

The portfolio thesis assumes we can execute on multiple products simultaneously:

- **Murphy**: B2B SaaS for agencies
- **SmartBoxes**: Developer platform with credit-based pricing
- **Nomos Cloud**: Infrastructure with open-source SDK and enterprise sales
- **P4gent**: Consumer product with viral growth mechanics

Each product has different:
- Target customers
- Go-to-market motions
- Success metrics
- Development requirements

A small team trying to do all four may do none well.

## Specific Threats

1. **Context switching**: Engineers moving between products lose productivity
2. **Support fragmentation**: Customer issues compete for attention across products
3. **Marketing dilution**: Brand and message get confused across different audiences
4. **Feature debt**: Products ship MVPs but never mature
5. **Burnout**: Team exhausted by breadth of demands

## Mitigations

### Product Strategy

- **Shared infrastructure**: All products run on SmartBoxes + Nomos. Improvements to infrastructure benefit everything.
- **Sequential focus**: Don't launch all products simultaneously. Establish each before moving to the next.
- **Ruthless prioritisation**: If a product isn't finding fit within 3 months, cut or pause it.
- **Dogfooding**: Our products help us build our products (Murphy for delivery control, SmartBoxes for automation).

### Team Structure

- **Platform team**: Core engineers focus on shared infrastructure
- **Product leads**: Each product has one accountable owner
- **Clear roadmaps**: No product gets worked on without a clear milestone

### Measurement

- **Per-product metrics**: Track acquisition, activation, retention separately for each product
- **Kill criteria**: Define upfront what "not working" looks like for each product
- **Weekly reviews**: Surface resource conflicts early

## Residual Risk

Ambition exceeds capacity. The honest answer is: we'll learn which products to focus on by trying them. The mitigation is being willing to cut products that don't work rather than spreading thinner.

**Probability**: Medium (common startup failure mode)
**Impact**: High (could prevent any product from succeeding)
**Mitigation effectiveness**: Moderate (discipline helps, but pressure is real)
