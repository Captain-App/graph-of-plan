# Nomos Cloud

Nomos Cloud is the hosted platform for domain-driven API generation.

## What it is

Nomos Cloud allows teams to:

- Define business domains in a typed, validated format
- Generate APIs, SDKs, CLIs, and MCP tools from a single source
- Deploy and version domain interfaces without code
- Ensure consistency across all interface formats

## Target users

- API platform teams
- Backend engineers building domain services
- Teams exposing functionality to AI agents via MCP

## Differentiation

Traditional API-first approaches still require manual SDK generation and documentation. Nomos compiles everything from the domain model, eliminating drift and inconsistency.
