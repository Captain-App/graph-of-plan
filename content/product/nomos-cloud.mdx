# Nomos Cloud

Nomos Cloud is the hosted platform for domain-driven API generation and agent execution auditing. It makes AI systems auditable and debuggable via append-only decision traces.

## The Short Version

Every AI agent takes actions. Most leave no trace of why. Nomos Cloud is an agent execution gateway that emits "chains of truth"—append-only, queryable decision traces that capture not just what happened, but why it was allowed. Think of it as event sourcing for AI: every intent, directive, policy evaluation, and approval becomes a permanent, auditable record.

## The Problem

The industry is waking up to context graphs—the idea that the most valuable thing you can store isn't the AI's chain-of-thought, but the decision context: who requested it, what policy approved it, what precedent justified it, and what artifacts it produced.

Most agent systems either:
- Have no audit trail at all
- Log raw text that's impossible to query
- Lose context when sessions end

Nomos captures the decision graph as first-class data, making every agent action traceable back to its authorization and forward to its consequences.

## Our Approach

### Event-Sourced Architecture

Nomos is built on event sourcing principles: every change is captured as an immutable event. This means:
- **Deterministic replay**: Rebuild any state by replaying events
- **Local-first**: Work offline, sync when connected
- **Full auditability**: Every decision is traceable

### Core Concepts: Intents → Directives → Events

The data model follows a clear flow:
1. **Intents**: What the user or agent wants to do
2. **Directives**: What actions are permitted based on policy
3. **Events**: What actually happened, with full context

This isn't a blockchain—there's no global consensus. Instead, Nomos models many overlapping, queryable chains by workspace, run, timeline, correlation, or entity.

### Stories, Not Logs

A normal audit log is a crime against human attention. Nomos stores templates and variables, rendering human-readable stories on the read path:

> "Sarah asked: Who owes us money? Agent queried Xero. Found 12 overdue invoices totaling £47,230. Agent drafted reminders. Finance approved. Messages sent."

The raw structured trace remains canonical—stories are just a view. This avoids persisting PII-heavy narratives while keeping the audit trail complete.

## How It Works

### OpenAPI/MCP Generation from Domain Models

Define business domains in a typed, validated format. Nomos generates:
- REST APIs with OpenAPI specs
- SDKs in multiple languages
- CLI tools
- MCP tools for AI agent integration

Everything compiles from the domain model, eliminating drift between documentation, API, and implementation.

### Cloudflare-Native Hosting

Built entirely on Cloudflare primitives:
- **Workers**: HTTP APIs
- **Durable Objects**: Per-timeline sequencing
- **R2**: Immutable ledger storage
- **Queues**: Async indexing
- **Workflows**: Heavy derivations
- **D1**: Query indexes

Every tenant gets logically isolated storage. Compute scales to zero. No Kubernetes to manage.

### Adapters for Everything

The SDK includes adapters that transform existing telemetry into Nomos entries:
- OpenTelemetry spans become events with correlation preserved
- OpenAI and Anthropic tool calls become directives
- MCP tool invocations become policy-checked directives

You don't rewrite your agent—you instrument it with a few lines.

## Product Features

### @nomos/router-sdk

The open-source TypeScript SDK: entry schema definitions, ID generation (UUIDv7 for time-sortable IDs), story template helpers, safe redaction utilities, and adapters. MIT-licensed.

### Nomos Cloud Service

The managed service: ingest API, query API, story rendering, web dashboard, and all compliance/enterprise features. Customers get a workspace URL, drop in the SDK, and start capturing traces immediately.

### Web Dashboard

Timeline visualization showing entries as a scrollable, zoomable graph. Story view rendering human-readable narratives. Chain explorer for following correlation links. Entity history showing all actions affecting a specific customer/account/resource.

## Who It's For

### AI Agent Developers

Anyone building autonomous systems needs to understand what their agents did and why, debug unexpected behavior, and demonstrate compliance. Nomos gives them a single place to capture and query decision traces across their entire agent fleet.

### Regulated Industries

Finance, healthcare, legal, and government need audit trails that survive legal scrutiny. Nomos provides tamper-evident logs, cryptographic proofs, and the ability to reconstruct exactly what happened at any point.

### Enterprise AI Teams

Large organizations deploying AI across multiple teams need centralized visibility: which agents are running, what actions they're taking, which policies are being applied. Nomos is the control plane for enterprise AI governance.

## Business Model

### The Neo4j Model

The underlying technology—the ledger schema, the SDK, the adapters—is fully open-source under a permissive license. Anyone can run Nomos on their own infrastructure.

The business model is convenience: businesses pay for hosted infrastructure, compliance guarantees, a web dashboard with visualizations, and enterprise features they don't want to build themselves.

### Pricing

- **Free Tier**: Generous limits for hobbyists and startups
- **Usage-Based**: Pay for entries stored and queries executed
- **Enterprise**: SOC 2, SSO, RBAC, custom retention, dedicated support

### Pricing Rationale

**Competitor benchmark:**

| Product | Price | Model |
|---------|-------|-------|
| LangSmith | £31-400/mo | Usage-based tiers |
| Helicone | Free-£12-120/mo | Usage-based |
| Datadog APM | £25+/host/mo | Per-host + usage |
| New Relic | Usage-based | Per-ingest volume |

**Our positioning:**

Nomos Cloud charges for value delivered: entries stored and queries executed. This scales naturally with agent deployment—small experiments are cheap; production workloads pay proportionally.

**Value anchor:**

- ARPU: £150/mo for production usage
- Compare to: Building internal audit infrastructure (£50k+ engineering time)
- Compare to: Compliance audit failure (£100k+ fines, reputation damage)
- Breakeven: One avoided compliance incident pays for years of Nomos

**Price confidence:**

- Free tier enables SDK adoption without friction
- Usage-based grows with customer value
- Enterprise tier captures compliance requirements
- 90% gross margin supports sales investment

### Compliance & Certifications

For regulated industries: SOC 2 Type II certification, GDPR data processing agreements, HIPAA BAAs for healthcare, and custom data residency options. Tamper-evident hash chaining with cryptographic proofs available for audit.

## Unit Economics

### Revenue Formula

```
Monthly Revenue = (SDK Conversions × ARPU) + Enterprise MRR

SDK conversions:
  Downloads/mo × Conversion rate = Customers
  1,000 × 3% = 30 new customers/mo

Revenue mix:
  Usage-based:  Customers × £150/mo ARPU
  Enterprise:   1 deal/quarter × £25k ACV = £2,083/mo
```

### Cost Structure

| Type | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Base ops | £5,000/mo | Platform, support, compliance |
| Per-customer | £15/mo | Cloudflare compute, R2 storage |

**Unit margin**: £150 ARPU - £15 infra = £135 gross profit (90% margin).

### Acquisition Strategy

**Primary channel: Open-source SDK → hosted conversion (the Neo4j model)**

The £100 CAC reflects a developer-led, open-source-first acquisition model:

| Channel | % of Acquisition | Why It Works |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Open-source SDK adoption | 50% | MIT-licensed SDK gets usage; cloud converts convenience buyers |
| Agent framework integrations | 25% | Adapters for LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI bring SDK to existing users |
| Technical content | 15% | "Event sourcing for AI agents" positions Nomos as the authority |
| Enterprise inbound | 10% | Compliance teams searching for "AI audit trails" find Nomos |

**The Neo4j playbook:**

1. **Open source first**: SDK is MIT-licensed, anyone can self-host
2. **Cloud convenience**: Managed service removes operational burden
3. **Enterprise pull**: Compliance requirements make hosted version necessary
4. **Land and expand**: Start with one team's audit needs, expand across the org

**Why this CAC is achievable:**

1. **Zero-friction trial**: SDK download → cloud sync is one config change
2. **Developer advocacy**: Every SDK user is a potential advocate to their org
3. **Enterprise deal size**: £25k ACV makes higher-touch sales economical
4. **Regulatory tailwinds**: AI governance requirements create demand

**Conversion funnel:**
- SDK downloads: 1,000/month (target)
- Free tier signup: 30% of downloaders
- Paid conversion: 10% of free tier
- Enterprise upgrade: 1 deal/quarter at £25k ACV

**Proof points needed**: 3 enterprise logos using Nomos for compliance audit trails.
