# SmartBoxes

SmartBoxes is our flagship execution environment product for AI agents.

## What it is

SmartBoxes provides isolated, capability-scoped workspaces where agents can:

- Execute code safely within defined boundaries
- Access files, databases, and APIs through explicit grants
- Snapshot and restore state at any point
- Operate on real environments, not simulations

## Target users

- Development teams building AI-powered applications
- Enterprises deploying autonomous agents at scale
- Platform teams needing secure agent execution infrastructure

## Differentiation

Unlike generic sandboxes or containers, SmartBoxes is purpose-built for agent workflows with first-class support for capability-based permissions and state materialisation.
