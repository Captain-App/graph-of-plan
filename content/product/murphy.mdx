# Murphy

Murphy is an AI-powered operations assistant for infrastructure and DevOps.

## What it is

Murphy is an autonomous agent that:

- Monitors infrastructure and responds to incidents
- Executes remediation within SmartBox boundaries
- Interacts with systems through Nomos-generated interfaces
- Learns from operational patterns to prevent future issues

## Target users

- DevOps and SRE teams
- Platform engineering organisations
- Companies with complex infrastructure requiring 24/7 monitoring

## Differentiation

Murphy combines the execution safety of SmartBoxes with domain-aware interfaces from Nomos. It can take action, not just alert—but only within explicitly granted capabilities.

## Why "Murphy"

Named after Murphy's Law: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." Murphy is there when it does.
