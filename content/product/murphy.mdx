# Murphy

Murphy is a delivery autopilot: it reads Jira/Linear/GitHub, builds a live model of dependencies and constraints, and tells leaders what will slip, why, and what to do next—early enough to change the outcome.

## The Short Version

Modern teams don't miss deadlines because they "didn't work hard enough." They miss deadlines because work is a web of dependencies and bottlenecks, and humans can't continuously model the knock-on effects across their work tools. Murphy connects to your task trackers, builds a live model of how work actually flows, and continuously answers three questions: What will slip? Why will it slip? What's the smallest intervention to get back to green?

## The Problem

**Status colours are a lie.**

Most project tools are lists and status colours. They look fine right up until the moment they don't. Common failure patterns include:

- "Everything is green" until integration week
- Teams optimising for utilisation instead of throughput
- Safety margins hidden inside tasks which encourages slow starts and late panic
- Hours spent in sync meetings doing what software should do: connect dots and predict risk

People spend hours doing what software should do: connecting dots and predicting risk.

## Our Approach

**Delivery control, not project management.**

Murphy treats your task tracker like a sensor and your project like a live system. It's inspired by **Theory of Constraints**: in any complex system, throughput is limited by a constraint, and "keeping everyone busy" usually makes delivery worse.

We don't promise "perfect plans." We promise fewer surprises.

### The Constraint Matters

Instead of asking "are tasks on schedule?", Murphy asks "what is currently limiting throughput?" Murphy identifies the **Critical Chain**: the sequence of work that dictates the delivery date when you consider both dependencies and who can actually do the work.

### Project Buffers

Traditional plans hide safety in every task estimate. Murphy strips safety out of individual tasks and aggregates it into a **Project Buffer** protecting the final goal. This eliminates Parkinson's Law and Student Syndrome, focusing effort where it actually impacts the delivery date.

### AI Predictive Monitoring

Murphy watches buffer burn vs progress. If you've used 50% of the buffer but completed only 20% of the critical chain, Murphy flags risk early and points to the specific task consuming the safety margin. This is continuous monitoring and proactive intervention, not a retrospective report.

### The Look Ahead Algorithm

Most planning tools treat work as a prioritised list. Murphy starts differently: **all tasks must get done**, and without explicit planning, the safe assumption is they happen sequentially.

This means Murphy initialises every project as a PERT chart with all tasks in a straight line—the worst-case schedule where nothing runs in parallel:

```
INITIAL STATE: Sequential (default assumption)
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                               │
│  [A]───[B]───[C]───[D]───[E]───[F]───[G]───[H]               │
│                                                               │
│   ↑ All tasks in sequence = longest possible timeline         │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

                    ↓ Look Ahead Analysis ↓

OPTIMISED: Parallel paths discovered
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                               │
│              ┌───[B]───[D]───┐                               │
│              │               │                               │
│  [A]─────────┼───[C]─────────┼───[G]───[H]                   │
│              │               │                               │
│              └───[E]───[F]───┘                               │
│                                                               │
│   ↑ Same tasks, shorter timeline via parallelisation          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How Look Ahead works:**

1. **Initialise**: All tasks from Jira/Linear/GitHub are placed on the PERT chart in a single sequential chain, ordered by priority
2. **Look Ahead**: AI scans forward through the chain asking "does this task actually depend on the one before it?"
3. **Analyse**: For each potential dependency, Murphy examines descriptions, linked issues, code references, and historical patterns to determine if the dependency is real
4. **Promote**: Tasks with no true dependency on their predecessor are promoted to parallel tracks
5. **Identify Critical Chain**: The longest remaining dependent path becomes the critical chain; parallel tracks become feeding chains

**The key insight:**

Other tools ask "what should we work on next?" Murphy asks "what's actually blocking what?" The difference:

- **List-based tools**: Assume flexibility—pick the highest priority available task
- **Murphy**: Assumes commitment—all tasks will ship, so the only question is *how fast*

By starting with the pessimistic sequential view and proving parallelisation opportunities, Murphy shows exactly how much schedule compression is possible and where the real constraints lie.

- Every intervention and decision is traceable

## Product Features

### Delivery Dashboard

Green / Amber / Red confidence for each milestone and release. See predicted slip (if any) and the single biggest driver. "What to do next" recommendations provide one intervention at a time to get the project back on track.

### Control Plane

A live dependency map (PERT-style view) highlighting the critical chain. View buffer status in real-time and see exactly where the safety margin is being consumed across the project graph.

### Alerts & Reports

Slack/email alerts when confidence changes. Weekly summaries including top risks, new constraints, interventions taken, and delivery trends. Keeps stakeholders informed without constant manual reporting.

### Deep Integrations

Murphy integrates with Linear, GitHub, and Jira to extract the real dependency graph and keep it current. It turns the data already in your work tools into continuous delivery control.

## Who It's For

### Primary: Agencies & Consultancies

Agencies delivering client work with cross-team dependencies have the strongest pain, clearest ROI, and shortest adoption cycles. Murphy helps them defend timelines with clients, reduce last-minute firefighting, and protect project margins.

### Secondary: R&D & Ops

R&D-heavy product teams with "release trains", manufacturing or hardware-adjacent programmes, and ops/delivery leadership who need portfolio-wide early warning. These organisations face direct costs from delivery slips: revenue loss, reputation damage, or contractual penalties.

## Business Model

### Pricing

- **Team** (£299–£499/mo): For a single delivery team
- **Studio** (£799–£1,499/mo): For agencies with multiple client projects and client-facing views
- **Enterprise** (£2,500+/mo): For portfolio views, SSO, and audit retention

### Pricing Rationale

**Competitor benchmark:**

| Product | Price | Scope |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Linear | £8-14/user/mo | Issue tracking (no prediction) |
| Forecast.app | £29-49/user/mo | Full PM suite with AI scheduling |
| Monday.com | £9-19/user/mo | General project management |
| Jira Premium | £14/user/mo | Advanced roadmaps, no AI analysis |

**Our positioning:**

Murphy charges per team, not per user. A 10-person delivery team pays £299-499/mo vs. £290-490/mo for Forecast at the same headcount. The value is different: Murphy predicts slips; Forecast schedules tasks.

**Value anchor:**

- One caught slip before it becomes a crisis = £5,000-50,000 saved (overtime, client penalty, reputation)
- Breakeven: Catch one slip every 10-17 months at Team tier
- Agencies report average 2-3 near-misses per quarter they wish they'd caught earlier

**Price confidence:**

- Team tier is accessible for agencies evaluating tools
- Studio tier captures value from multi-project visibility
- Enterprise tier reflects procurement and compliance requirements

### Go-to-Market

1. **Phase 1**: Design partners for credibility (5–10 delivery leads)
2. **Phase 2**: Agency wedge for margin protection and client defense
3. **Phase 3**: Expand into larger product organisations with bigger budgets and more complexity

## Unit Economics

### Revenue Formula

```
MRR = Teams × ARPU
    = 15 × £600 = £9,000/mo

Where ARPU = blended average across tiers:
  Team £299-£499, Studio £799-£1,499, Enterprise £2,500+
```

### Cost Structure

| Type | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fixed | £2,000/mo | Infrastructure, monitoring, support tooling |
| Variable | 20% of revenue | Scales with usage: compute, storage, support |

**Break-even**: 4 teams at blended ARPU covers fixed costs.

### Key Metrics

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ARPU: £600    │  Margin: 80%     │  LTV: £11,520    │
│  CAC: £500     │  Payback: <1mo   │  LTV:CAC: 23:1   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Acquisition Strategy

**Primary channel: Agency referrals + delivery consultants**

The £500 CAC reflects a trust-based, relationship-driven acquisition model:

| Channel | % of Acquisition | Why It Works |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Agency referrals | 50% | Delivery leads talk to each other. One win creates warm intros |
| Delivery consultants | 30% | Partner channel with aligned incentives (they look good when projects deliver) |
| Content/SEO | 15% | "Critical chain" and "Theory of Constraints" keywords attract qualified traffic |
| Direct outreach | 5% | Cold outbound to agencies with public delivery problems |

**Why this CAC is achievable:**

1. **High-trust sale**: Agencies don't buy from ads—they buy from peers and trusted advisors
2. **Consultant multiplier**: One consultant relationship yields multiple client introductions
3. **Natural word-of-mouth**: When Murphy catches a slip early, the delivery lead tells everyone
4. **Content compounds**: Theory of Constraints content has 10+ year keyword relevance

**Proof points needed**: 3 case studies showing interventions that saved timelines.

### Year 1 Projection

| Month | Teams | MRR | Expenses | Net | Cumulative |
|-------|-------|-----|----------|-----|------------|
| M1 | 1 | £600 | £2,000 | -£1,400 | -£1,400 |
| M3 | 7 | £4,200 | £2,500 | £1,700 | -£3,300 |
| M6 | 16 | £9,600 | £3,300 | £6,300 | £16,000 |
| M12 | 31 | £18,600 | £4,500 | £14,100 | £68,000 |

*Assumes: First paid customer M1, +3 teams/mo growth, 5% monthly churn.*

### Sensitivity

| Scenario | M12 Teams | M12 MRR | Y1 Net |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Base** (3/mo, 5% churn) | 31 | £18,600 | £68k |
| Aggressive (5/mo, 3% churn) | 52 | £31,200 | £120k |
| Conservative (2/mo, 8% churn) | 18 | £10,800 | £24k |

## Roadmap

### M0: Make it Buyable
Core integrations (Jira, Linear, GitHub), automated onboarding flow, the first delivery dashboard, and automated alerts. Establishing the billing and plan tiers to allow for early conversion.

### M1: Make it Sticky
Weekly delivery reports, intervention tracking (flagging X, recording Y, measuring outcome Z), and initial portfolio views for delivery leads managing multiple streams.

### M2: Scale Distribution
Agency-specific workspace templates, public case studies showing "delivery control stories", and building out a partner channel with delivery consultancies.

### M3: Enterprise
SSO and audit retention for enterprise customers. Security review packs and annual contracts to support larger procurement processes.

### Year 2: Growth Phase

**Product expansion:**
- Jira Server/Data Center support (on-prem enterprise)
- AI-generated intervention recommendations (not just alerts)
- Team performance insights (anonymized, constraint-focused)
- Portfolio-level constraint analysis across multiple projects

**Target metrics:**
- 50+ paying teams
- £30K MRR
- 3 enterprise logos
- NPS > 50

### Year 3: Scale Phase

**Platform maturity:**
- API marketplace for custom integrations
- White-label offering for delivery consultancies
- Predictive resource allocation recommendations
- Multi-org portfolio views for holding companies

**Revenue targets:**
- £75K MRR
- 100+ paying teams
- 5+ enterprise contracts (£100K+ ACV)
- International expansion (US market entry)

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Trust**: Win via accuracy of early-warning interventions, not just charts
- **Adoption**: Avoid tool fatigue by integrating deeply into existing workflows (Jira/Linear)
- **Culture**: Position as system-level constraint management, not individual surveillance

## Why "Murphy"

Named after Murphy's Law: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." Murphy is there when it does—but it tells you *before* it happens.
