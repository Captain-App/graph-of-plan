# P4gent

P4gent is your purchasing assistant—an AI agent that tracks your suppliers, monitors your spend, finds alternatives, and drafts communications with the context of each relationship.

## The Short Version

Small businesses and individuals spend hours managing suppliers: comparing prices, chasing invoices, finding alternatives when costs rise, and maintaining relationships. P4gent handles the operational overhead of procurement so you can focus on decisions, not administration.

## The Problem

**Procurement is death by a thousand cuts.**

Unless you're big enough for a procurement team, supplier management falls through the cracks:

- Subscriptions auto-renew at higher rates because nobody checked
- You're paying more than you need to because comparing alternatives takes time you don't have
- Supplier relationships go cold because follow-up emails don't write themselves
- Cost visibility is a spreadsheet you update once a quarter (if that)
- When you need to cut costs, you don't know where to start

The irony: the information exists—in emails, invoices, bank statements—but synthesising it requires time you're supposedly saving money to buy.

## Our Approach

**Your purchasing department, population: one AI.**

P4gent connects to your email, accounting software, and bank feeds to build a live picture of your supplier relationships. It doesn't just track spend—it understands context: who you've been with for years, who's been raising prices, who you've been meaning to review.

### Relationship-Aware

P4gent knows that your conversation with a supplier you've used for 5 years is different from a cold outreach to a new vendor. When it drafts emails, it uses the context you've provided plus what it's learned from your history.

### Proactive, Not Reactive

P4gent doesn't wait for you to ask. It notices when:
- A renewal is coming up and prices have changed
- A supplier you use has a competitor offering better terms
- Your spend in a category has drifted from budget
- An invoice doesn't match the agreed rate

### Human in the Loop

P4gent drafts, you decide. Every email goes through you before sending. Every significant decision surfaces for approval. It's an assistant, not an autonomous buyer.

## Product Features

### Spend Dashboard

See your supplier spend across all categories. Track trends over time. Know exactly where your money goes without manually updating spreadsheets.

### Supplier Intelligence

For each supplier, P4gent maintains:
- **Relationship history**: How long, how much, key contacts
- **Pricing trends**: Are they raising rates? By how much?
- **Contract terms**: Renewal dates, notice periods, commitments
- **Notes**: Your context about the relationship

### Alternative Finder

When costs rise or contracts renew, P4gent researches alternatives:
- Finds comparable suppliers in your market
- Compares pricing where available
- Flags switching costs and risks
- Drafts outreach emails if you want to explore

### Communication Drafts

P4gent drafts supplier emails with context:
- **Renewal negotiations**: "Based on our 3-year history and current market rates..."
- **Invoice queries**: "The attached invoice shows £X but our agreed rate is £Y..."
- **Relationship maintenance**: "It's been a while since we reviewed our arrangement..."

Every draft goes to you for review. You edit, approve, and send.

### Alerts & Reminders

- Renewal coming up in 30 days
- Invoice received that's higher than expected
- Spend in category X is 20% over last quarter
- Alternative found that could save £Y/month

## Who It's For

### Freelancers & Solopreneurs

You're running everything yourself. P4gent handles the supplier admin so you can focus on the work that pays.

### Small Businesses

Big enough to have real supplier complexity, too small for a procurement person. P4gent fills the gap.

### Anyone Managing Household Spend

Subscriptions, utilities, insurance, services—P4gent tracks them all and makes sure you're not overpaying.

## Business Model

### Pricing

- **Personal** (£9/mo): Up to 20 suppliers, basic integrations
- **Pro** (£29/mo): Unlimited suppliers, full integrations, alternative finder
- **Business** (£79/mo): Multi-user, team inbox, advanced analytics

### Pricing Rationale

**Competitor benchmark:**

| Product | Price | Scope |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Ramp | Free (card interchange) | Corporate card + expense management |
| Brex | Free-£12/user/mo | Corporate financial platform |
| Pleo | £35-89/user/mo | Spend management |
| Payhawk | £50+/user/mo | Corporate cards + AP |

**Our positioning:**

P4gent is radically cheaper because we don't provide financial infrastructure—just intelligence on top of what you already have. No corporate cards, no banking, no interchange revenue to subsidize.

**Value anchor:**

- Personal tier: £9/mo = cost of one forgotten subscription month
- Pro tier: £29/mo = one coffee per week
- Business tier: £79/mo = less than one hour of admin time
- Breakeven: Catch one auto-renewal or find one better deal

**Price confidence:**

- Personal tier is impulse-purchase territory (£9)
- Pro tier captures serious solopreneurs who want automation
- Business tier addresses small teams without procurement staff
- All tiers have obvious, immediate ROI potential

### The Economics

If P4gent saves you one hour per month on supplier admin, it's paid for itself. If it catches one auto-renewal or finds one better deal, it's paid for the year.

## Unit Economics

### Revenue Formula

```
MRR = Subscribers × Blended ARPU

Tier breakdown (expected):
  Personal (£9):   60% of users
  Pro (£29):       30% of users
  Business (£79):  10% of users
  ─────────────────────────────
  Blended ARPU:    £22/mo
```

### Cost Structure

| Type | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Base ops | £500/mo | Support tools, marketing baseline |
| Per-user | £2/mo | Xero API, email service, SmartBox compute |

**Key insight**: Runs on SmartBox/Nomos infrastructure. Variable costs are API calls, not compute.

### Key Metrics

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ARPU: £22       │  Margin: 90%      │  LTV: £250      │
│  CAC: £20        │  Payback: <1mo    │  LTV:CAC: 12:1  │
│  Churn: 8%/mo    │  (Consumer product, higher churn)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Acquisition Strategy

**Primary channel: Consumer ads + word-of-mouth virality**

The £20 CAC reflects a low-friction, consumer-native acquisition model:

| Channel | % of Acquisition | Why It Works |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Social ads (Meta/TikTok) | 40% | Visual demos of "AI that saved me £500/month" convert |
| Word-of-mouth | 30% | Freelancers share money-saving tools with peers |
| SME influencers | 20% | Bookkeepers, accountants, business coaches recommend |
| SEO/content | 10% | "How to audit your subscriptions" brings problem-aware traffic |

**Why this CAC is achievable:**

1. **Obvious ROI hook**: "Cancel one forgotten subscription and it pays for itself"
2. **Screenshot-worthy moments**: Savings alerts are shareable content
3. **Referral mechanics**: Built-in "share to save" incentives
4. **No-code simplicity**: Anyone can connect email and Xero in 5 minutes

**Consumer acquisition playbook:**

- **Hook**: "Your AI accountant that actually saves you money"
- **Proof**: Real savings numbers from real users
- **Friction**: Free tier lets users see savings before paying
- **Viral loop**: Share your savings dashboard, get credits

**Why 8% churn is acceptable:**

Consumer products naturally churn higher. The economics work because:
- CAC is low (£20)
- Payback is instant (under 1 month)
- Some users return when they get new suppliers to manage
- High-value users upgrade to Pro/Business tiers

**Proof points needed**: 10 user testimonials with specific £ saved.
