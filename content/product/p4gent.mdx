# P4gent

P4gent is an AI agent framework built on SmartBoxes and Nomos.

## What it is

P4gent provides:

- A runtime for long-running autonomous agents
- Built-in access to SmartBoxes for isolated execution
- Nomos-generated interfaces for domain interaction
- Observability and control plane for agent operations

## Target users

- Teams building production AI agents
- Developers who need agents that operate beyond single-turn interactions
- Enterprises requiring auditable, controllable agent execution

## Differentiation

Most agent frameworks focus on prompt engineering and tool calling. P4gent provides the execution infrastructure that makes agents production-ready: isolation, state management, and domain-aware interfaces.
