# Twilio

Twilio provides messaging interfaces that let users interact with their SmartBoxes through WhatsApp, SMS, and other channels.

## Why Twilio

Twilio offers the most comprehensive programmable communications platform:

- **WhatsApp Business API**: Official WhatsApp integration for business messaging
- **Global reach**: Send and receive messages worldwide
- **Reliable delivery**: Enterprise-grade message delivery infrastructure
- **Rich media**: Support for images, documents, and interactive messages

## How We Use It

Twilio powers conversational interfaces for SmartBoxes:

- **WhatsApp interface**: Chat with your SmartBox from WhatsApp
- **SMS notifications**: Receive alerts and updates via text
- **Multi-channel conversations**: Unified inbox across messaging platforms

## The Vision

Instead of opening a dashboard, users can message their SmartBox:

> "Hey, check if the build passed and deploy to production if it did"

The SmartBox receives the message via Twilio, executes the task, and responds in the same conversation thread. This makes AI agent interaction as simple as texting a colleague.
