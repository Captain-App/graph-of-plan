# Cloudflare

Cloudflare provides the serverless infrastructure that powers our execution platform.

## Why Cloudflare

Cloudflare's developer platform offers a unique combination of primitives that align with our architecture:

- **Edge-first**: Compute runs close to users globally
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage, scales to zero
- **Integrated**: Workers, Durable Objects, R2, D1, and Queues work seamlessly together
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use

## How We Use It

Our platform is built entirely on Cloudflare primitives:

- **Workers**: HTTP APIs and request handling
- **Durable Objects**: Per-entity state and coordination
- **R2**: Object storage for files and blobs
- **D1**: SQLite at the edge for structured data
- **Queues**: Async job processing
- **Workflows**: Long-running orchestration
- **Pages**: Static site hosting and deployment

This architecture means we have no traditional servers, databases, or Kubernetes clusters to manage.
