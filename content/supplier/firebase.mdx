# Firebase (Google Cloud)

Firebase provides an alternative backend infrastructure for Nomos persistence, offering a different deployment model than Cloudflare.

## Why Firebase

Firebase offers a mature, battle-tested platform with strong mobile and real-time capabilities:

- **Real-time sync**: Firestore's real-time listeners for live updates
- **Offline support**: Built-in offline persistence and sync
- **Authentication**: Comprehensive auth with multiple providers
- **Ecosystem**: Deep integration with Google Cloud services

## Supplier Choice

Nomos supports multiple persistence backends. Firebase is the alternative to Cloudflare for teams that:

- Already use Google Cloud infrastructure
- Need Firebase Authentication integration
- Prefer Firestore's real-time sync model
- Want to deploy to existing Firebase projects

## nomos_persistence

The `nomos_persistence` Dart packages provide Firebase-backed storage:

- **Event storage**: Firestore collections for event streams
- **Blob storage**: Cloud Storage for large artifacts
- **Auth integration**: Firebase Auth for identity
- **Functions**: Cloud Functions for server-side logic

This allows the same Nomos domain models to work across different infrastructure choices.
