Convex is a reactive backend platform with a TypeScript-first database.

## Why Consider Convex

- **Simpler model**: Database + functions in one platform
- **Reactive by default**: Real-time sync built in
- **TypeScript native**: End-to-end type safety
- **Less infrastructure**: No separate DB, queues, storage to manage

## Trade-offs vs Cloudflare

| Aspect | Cloudflare | Convex |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Control | More primitives, more control | Simpler, more opinionated |
| Edge | Global edge deployment | Centralised (US regions) |
| Pricing | Pay-per-request | Pay-per-function-call |
| Maturity | Established | Newer, smaller |
| Lock-in | Lower (standard APIs) | Higher (proprietary) |

## Potential Use

Convex may be suitable for:
- Simpler domains that don't need edge deployment
- Rapid prototyping before Cloudflare migration
- Real-time collaborative features
