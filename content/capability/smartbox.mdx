# Smartbox: capability-scoped execution workspaces

A Smartbox is an execution environment where intent is materialised into state and arbitrary computation is permitted within explicit bounds.

Agents operate on files and SDKs, not tools. This mirrors how developers already work.

## Core concept

A Smartbox combines:

- **A sandboxed filesystem**: Isolated from the host, snapshotted at will
- **Capability-based permissions**: Fine-grained control over what the agent can access
- **Stateful execution**: The environment persists across agent interactions
- **Materialised context**: The workspace reflects the current state of the task

## Why this matters

Traditional agent architectures pass context through message history. This is fundamentally limited—you cannot pass a running database or a complex file tree through a prompt.

Smartbox inverts this: the agent operates *inside* the context. Files exist. Databases run. APIs are reachable. The agent manipulates reality, not representations of reality.
