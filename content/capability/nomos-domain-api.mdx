# Nomos: domains compiled to OpenAPI, MCP, CLI and SDKs

Nomos is a system for expressing business domains in a way that compiles to multiple interface formats.

## The problem

Every domain ends up implemented multiple times:

- Once as an API (REST, GraphQL)
- Once as CLI commands
- Once as SDK methods
- Once as agent tool definitions

Each implementation drifts. Invariants are enforced inconsistently. Documentation lags reality.

## The solution

Define the domain once, in a typed, validated format. Compile to all targets.

Nomos provides:

- **Single source of truth**: The domain model is authoritative
- **Generated interfaces**: OpenAPI, MCP tools, CLI, SDKs all derived
- **Enforced invariants**: Business rules checked at compile time
- **Consistent documentation**: Generated from the same source

For agents, this means they interact with domains through well-typed, well-documented interfaces that cannot contradict each other.
