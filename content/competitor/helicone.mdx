# Helicone

Helicone is an open-source LLM observability platform providing request logging, cost tracking, and caching for AI applications.

## Overview

**Company**: Helicone (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2023
**Funding**: $6.5M (Seed, Y Combinator)
**Pricing**: Free tier (generous), Pro at $20/mo, Team at $150/mo, Enterprise custom

## What They Do

Helicone provides LLM observability through a proxy:
- **Request logging**: Capture all LLM API calls
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor spend by model, user, feature
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with intelligent response caching
- **Rate limiting**: Control usage at the application level
- **Prompt management**: Version and test prompts

## Where We Overlap

### Nomos Cloud vs. Helicone

Both capture AI system behavior. Both provide dashboards and analytics. Both care about cost visibility.

**Shared concerns**:
- What is the AI doing?
- How much is it costing?
- How do we debug issues?

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | Helicone | Nomos Cloud |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | Proxy layer | Event-sourced ledger |
| **Data captured** | LLM requests | Decision context |
| **Primary value** | Cost control | Compliance audit |
| **Output** | Dashboards | Chains of truth |
| **Open source** | Yes (core) | SDK only |

### Key Differences

1. **Proxy vs. Instrumentation**: Helicone is a proxy between your app and LLM. Nomos is instrumentation you add to capture decisions.

2. **Requests vs. Decisions**: Helicone logs API calls. Nomos logs business decisions with authorization context.

3. **Cost focus**: Helicone heavily emphasizes cost optimization (caching, rate limiting). Nomos emphasizes auditability.

4. **Open source model**: Helicone's core is open source. Nomos SDK is open source, but the compliance features are cloud-only.

5. **Enterprise compliance**: Nomos has SOC 2, HIPAA, tamper-evident chains. Helicone is developer-focused.

## Their Advantages

- **Open source**: Self-host option for cost-conscious teams
- **Simple integration**: Just change your API endpoint
- **Cost savings**: Caching can meaningfully reduce LLM costs
- **Price**: Free tier is very generous
- **Developer experience**: Streamlined setup and dashboards

## Positioning

Helicone is the best way to monitor and reduce LLM API costs. Nomos Cloud is for when you need decision audit trails that satisfy compliance.

**Our pitch to Helicone users**: "Helicone for cost control. Nomos for compliance. Use both."

**Our pitch to enterprises**: "Helicone tracks API calls. Nomos tracks decisions—who requested, what approved, why allowed."

## Market Differentiation

Different buyer profiles:
- Helicone: Cost-conscious developers, early-stage startups
- Nomos Cloud: Compliance-conscious enterprises, regulated industries

Little direct competition—serve different needs.
