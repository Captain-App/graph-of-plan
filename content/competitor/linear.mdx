# Linear

Linear is a modern issue tracker and project management tool built for software teams, known for its speed, keyboard-first design, and opinionated workflows.

## Overview

**Company**: Linear (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2019
**Funding**: $52M (Series B, Accel)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Standard at $8/user/mo, Plus at $14/user/mo

## Why They're Not a Competitor

**Linear tracks what needs to be done. Murphy predicts what will slip.**

| | Linear | Murphy |
|---|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Issue tracking | Delivery prediction |
| **Data** | Tasks and status | Dependencies and constraints |
| **Updates** | Humans update status | AI infers from patterns |
| **Output** | "Here's what's in progress" | "Here's what's going to be late" |

### The Core Difference

Linear is where work lives. Murphy reads from Linear (or Jira, or GitHub) and predicts delivery risk.

Murphy doesn't replace Linear—it's a layer on top. Teams keep using Linear for daily work. Murphy watches the patterns and warns when something will slip.

### The Relationship

Murphy integrates with Linear via OAuth:
- Read-only access to issues, cycles, projects
- No data lock-in or migration required
- Linear remains the system of record
- Murphy adds prediction and early warning

### When They'd Use Both

An agency using Linear for issue tracking adds Murphy to:
- See cross-project delivery risk
- Get early warning before deadlines slip
- Show clients confidence dashboards
- Identify bottlenecks across the portfolio

## Threat Level: Low

Linear could add predictive features, but it's not their focus. They're optimizing for speed and simplicity in issue tracking, not delivery intelligence. Complementary products.
