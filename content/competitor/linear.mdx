# Linear

Linear is a modern issue tracker and project management tool built for software teams, known for its speed, keyboard-first design, and opinionated workflows.

## Overview

**Company**: Linear (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2019
**Funding**: $52M (Series B, Accel)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Standard at $8/user/mo, Plus at $14/user/mo, Enterprise custom

## What They Do

Linear is issue tracking redesigned for speed:
- **Issue management**: Fast, keyboard-driven issue creation and triage
- **Cycles**: Time-boxed sprints with automatic rollover
- **Roadmaps**: Visual planning at the project and initiative level
- **Integrations**: GitHub, Slack, Figma, and extensive API

## Where We Overlap

### Murphy vs. Linear

Both serve delivery management. Linear is where work is tracked; Murphy analyzes whether it will ship on time.

**Apparent overlap**:
- Both care about software delivery
- Both show project status
- Both integrate with development tools

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | Linear | Murphy |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Track what to do | Predict what will slip |
| **Model** | List of issues | Dependency graph + constraints |
| **Analysis** | Manual status updates | AI-driven early warning |
| **Output** | Status boards | Intervention recommendations |
| **User** | Individual contributors | Delivery leads |

### Key Differences

1. **Reactive vs. Predictive**: Linear shows current status. Murphy predicts future problems.

2. **Tasks vs. Constraints**: Linear assumes tasks are independent. Murphy models dependencies and bottlenecks.

3. **Tool vs. Control System**: Linear is a system of record. Murphy is a control system that reads from Linear.

4. **Human updates vs. AI analysis**: Linear needs humans to update status. Murphy infers delivery risk from patterns.

5. **Complementary positioning**: Murphy isn't a replacement for Linear—it's a layer on top.

## Their Advantages

- **Adoption**: Large installed base of engineering teams
- **Daily use**: Teams live in Linear; it's their primary tool
- **Integrations**: Deep GitHub integration, API ecosystem
- **Brand**: Known for exceptional design and speed
- **Price**: $8-14/user is accessible for any team

## Positioning

Linear is the best issue tracker for fast-moving teams. Murphy is what you add when you need to know if you'll actually ship on time.

**Our pitch to Linear users**: "Keep using Linear. Add Murphy to catch slips before they happen."

**Our pitch to delivery leads**: "Linear tells you what's in progress. Murphy tells you what's going to be late."

## Integration Strategy

Murphy positions as a Linear power-up:
- One-click OAuth connection
- Read-only access (no lock-in concerns)
- Enhances Linear data with constraint analysis
- Linear remains the primary interface for ICs
