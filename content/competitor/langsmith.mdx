# LangSmith

LangSmith is an LLM observability and testing platform from LangChain, providing tracing, evaluation, and debugging tools for LLM applications.

## Overview

**Company**: LangChain (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2022
**Funding**: $35M+ (Series A, Sequoia)
**Pricing**: Free tier (limited), Developer at $39/mo, Team at $500/mo, Enterprise custom

## What They Do

LangSmith is the observability platform for LangChain applications:
- **Tracing**: Capture every LLM call, chain, and agent step
- **Debugging**: Replay and inspect failed runs
- **Evaluation**: Test prompts with datasets and scoring
- **Monitoring**: Latency, cost, and error rate dashboards
- **Datasets**: Manage test cases and golden examples

## Where We Overlap

### Nomos Cloud vs. LangSmith

Both provide observability for AI systems. Both capture traces. Both help debug agent behavior.

**Shared capabilities**:
- Trace capture and visualization
- Run replay and debugging
- Cost and latency monitoring

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | LangSmith | Nomos Cloud |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Scope** | LLM calls | Decision context |
| **Data model** | Spans and traces | Intents, directives, events |
| **Primary use** | Debugging | Compliance audit |
| **Output** | Technical dashboards | Human-readable stories |
| **Target** | ML engineers | Compliance + operations |

### Key Differences

1. **Debugging vs. Audit**: LangSmith optimizes for "why did this fail?" Nomos optimizes for "why was this allowed?"

2. **Technical vs. Compliance**: LangSmith serves ML engineers. Nomos serves compliance officers, legal, and executives.

3. **Spans vs. Decision Graph**: LangSmith captures function calls. Nomos captures business decisions with authorization context.

4. **Stories**: Nomos renders human-readable narratives. LangSmith shows technical traces.

5. **Framework agnostic**: Nomos works with any agent framework. LangSmith is optimized for LangChain.

## Their Advantages

- **LangChain ecosystem**: Tight integration with the most popular LLM framework
- **Developer adoption**: Large existing user base
- **Feature maturity**: More evaluation and testing features
- **Community**: Active community and documentation
- **Price**: Free tier is generous for development

## Positioning

LangSmith is the best debugging tool for LangChain applications. Nomos Cloud is for when you need audit trails that satisfy compliance and legal.

**Our pitch to LangSmith users**: "LangSmith for debugging. Nomos for compliance. You may need both."

**Our pitch to enterprises**: "LangSmith tells engineers what happened. Nomos tells compliance why it was allowed."

## Coexistence Strategy

These products can coexist:
- LangSmith for development and debugging
- Nomos Cloud for production audit and compliance

Position as complementary, not competitive, where possible.
