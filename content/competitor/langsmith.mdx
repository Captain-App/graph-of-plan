# LangSmith

LangSmith is an LLM observability and testing platform from LangChain, providing tracing, evaluation, and debugging tools for LLM applications.

## Overview

**Company**: LangChain (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2022
**Funding**: $35M+ (Series A, Sequoia)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Developer at $39/mo, Team at $500/mo

## Why They're Not a Direct Competitor

**LangSmith is for debugging. Nomos is for compliance.**

| | LangSmith | Nomos Cloud |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **User** | ML engineer | Compliance officer, legal, exec |
| **Question** | "Why did this fail?" | "Why was this allowed?" |
| **Data model** | Spans and traces | Decisions and authorizations |
| **Output** | Technical debugging UI | Human-readable audit trails |

### The Core Difference

LangSmith helps engineers fix broken AI systems. Nomos helps enterprises prove their AI systems followed the rules.

A LangSmith user:
- Is debugging a failed LLM chain
- Needs to see which prompt caused the error
- Wants latency and cost breakdowns
- Is optimizing model performance

A Nomos user:
- Is preparing for a compliance audit
- Needs to show why an AI made a specific decision
- Wants tamper-evident records
- Is proving governance to regulators or executives

### Complementary, Not Competitive

Many teams will use both:
- LangSmith in development and staging (debugging, evaluation)
- Nomos in production (audit trails, compliance)

The pitch: "LangSmith for debugging. Nomos for compliance. You need both."

### Framework Lock-In

LangSmith is tightly coupled to LangChain. Nomos is framework-agnostic—works with LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI, or custom agents.

## Threat Level: Low

LangSmith could add compliance features, but it's not their focus. They're optimizing for developers building with LangChain, not enterprises proving compliance.
