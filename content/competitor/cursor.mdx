# Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VSCode, offering inline completions, chat-based coding assistance, and codebase-aware AI features.

## Overview

**Company**: Anysphere (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2022
**Funding**: $60M+ (Series A, Andreessen Horowitz)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Pro at $20/mo, Business at $40/user/mo

## What They Do

Cursor is a fork of VSCode with deeply integrated AI:
- **Tab completion**: AI predicts your next edit across multiple lines
- **Chat**: Ask questions about your codebase
- **Composer**: Generate multi-file changes from natural language
- **Codebase indexing**: AI understands your entire project

## Where We Overlap

### SmartBoxes vs. Cursor

Both enable AI-assisted software development. The overlap is in the "AI writes code" space.

**Shared capabilities**:
- Natural language to code
- Multi-file editing
- Code generation and refactoring

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | Cursor | SmartBoxes |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Primary user** | Professional developer | Anyone with an idea |
| **Execution model** | Developer drives | Agent works autonomously |
| **Environment** | Local IDE | Hosted persistent sandbox |
| **Deployment** | Separate concern | Integrated (CF Pages/Workers) |
| **Scope** | Code editing | Full stack: code → deploy → maintain |

### Key Differences

1. **Audience**: Cursor is for developers who want AI assistance. SmartBoxes is for people who want AI to build for them.

2. **Autonomy**: Cursor waits for instructions. SmartBoxes can work overnight, notice issues, and act proactively.

3. **Persistence**: Cursor sessions end when you close the editor. SmartBoxes maintain state, memory, and context indefinitely.

4. **Deployment**: Cursor doesn't deploy. SmartBoxes include integrated deployment to production.

5. **Non-code tasks**: SmartBoxes handle documentation, monitoring, competitor analysis—anything an agent can do. Cursor is code-only.

## Their Advantages

- **Incumbent**: Already has developer mindshare and adoption
- **Polish**: Extremely refined editor experience
- **Speed**: Lower latency for inline completions
- **Price**: $20/mo is accessible for professional developers
- **Network effects**: Growing community and shared workflows

## Positioning

Cursor is the best AI-powered IDE for professional developers. SmartBoxes is for people who don't want to use an IDE at all—they want to describe what they need and have it built for them.

**Our pitch to Cursor users**: "When you want to describe a project and wake up to it being done, use SmartBoxes."

**Our pitch to non-developers**: "You don't need Cursor. You don't need to learn to code. SmartBoxes builds what you describe."
