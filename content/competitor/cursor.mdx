# Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VSCode, offering inline completions, chat-based coding assistance, and codebase-aware AI features.

## Overview

**Company**: Anysphere (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2022
**Funding**: $60M+ (Series A, Andreessen Horowitz)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Pro at $20/mo, Business at $40/user/mo

## Why They're Not a Direct Competitor

**Cursor is a tool you sit in front of. SmartBoxes work while you sleep.**

| | Cursor | SmartBoxes |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Model** | IDE with AI assistance | Autonomous agent sandbox |
| **Session** | Ends when you close it | Runs continuously |
| **User** | Developer at keyboard | Anyone with an idea |
| **Output** | Code you then deploy | Running application |

### The Core Difference

Cursor makes developers faster. SmartBoxes replace the need for a developer.

A Cursor user opens the editor, writes prompts, reviews suggestions, commits code, and deploys manually. They're driving; AI is assisting.

A SmartBoxes user describes what they want, then checks back later. The agent writes code, tests it, deploys it, monitors it, and iterates. The agent is driving; the human approves.

### When They'd Pick Cursor

- Professional developer who wants control
- Complex codebase requiring human judgment
- Prefers local development environment
- Already has deployment infrastructure

### When They'd Pick SmartBoxes

- Non-developer who wants a working tool
- Simple automation or internal app
- Wants "set and forget" operation
- No DevOps knowledge or interest

## Threat Level: Low

Cursor is not moving toward autonomous agents—they're doubling down on developer productivity. Different product philosophy, different customer.
