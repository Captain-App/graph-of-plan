## Where We Overlap

### Murphy vs. Forecast

Both address delivery predictability for project-based work. Both use AI to improve planning.

**Shared concerns**:
- Will the project ship on time?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What should we work on next?

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | Forecast | Murphy |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Scope** | Full PM suite | Delivery prediction layer |
| **Primary metric** | Profitability | On-time delivery |
| **Method** | AI scheduling | Critical chain analysis |
| **Integration** | Replace your tools | Enhance existing tools |
| **Target** | PSA/services firms | Any delivery team |

### Key Differences

1. **Platform vs. Layer**: Forecast wants to be your entire project management system. Murphy adds prediction to your existing tools.

2. **Profitability vs. Delivery**: Forecast optimizes for margin. Murphy optimizes for shipping on time.

3. **Scheduling vs. Constraint Analysis**: Forecast auto-schedules tasks. Murphy identifies the critical path and buffer consumption.

4. **Replace vs. Enhance**: Forecast requires migration. Murphy connects to Jira/Linear/GitHub you already use.

5. **Services focus**: Forecast is built for billable hours businesses. Murphy works for any delivery team.

## Their Advantages

- **Comprehensive**: Full suite means one tool for PM + resource + time
- **AI maturity**: Been doing AI-native PM longer
- **Services expertise**: Deep understanding of PSA/agency workflows
- **Financial integration**: Project profitability is built-in
- **Established**: Larger customer base and track record

## Positioning

Forecast is the best all-in-one PM platform for services businesses tracking profitability. Murphy is for teams that want delivery prediction without replacing their tools.

**Our pitch to Forecast evaluators**: "If you don't want to migrate your entire PM stack, add Murphy to your existing tools."

**Our pitch to agencies**: "Keep Jira/Linear. Add Murphy for critical chain analysis and early warning."

## Competitive Response

If a prospect is evaluating both:
- Emphasize non-disruptive integration (no migration)
- Focus on prediction methodology (Theory of Constraints, Critical Chain)
- Position Murphy as lighter weight and faster to value
- Acknowledge Forecast's strengths in profitability tracking
