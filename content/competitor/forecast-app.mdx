# Forecast.app

Forecast is an AI-native project management platform focused on resource planning, project profitability, and workload management for professional services.

## Overview

**Company**: Forecast (Copenhagen)
**Founded**: 2016
**Funding**: $19M (Series A, Balderton Capital)
**Pricing**: Lite at $29/user/mo, Pro at $49/user/mo, Enterprise custom

## Why They're Not a Direct Competitor

**Forecast requires migration. Murphy layers on existing tools.**

| | Forecast | Murphy |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Scope** | Full PM suite | Prediction layer |
| **Integration** | Replace Jira/Linear | Connect to Jira/Linear |
| **Primary metric** | Project profitability | On-time delivery |
| **Target** | PSA/services firms | Any delivery team |

### The Core Difference

Forecast wants to be your entire project management system. Murphy adds prediction to whatever you already use.

An agency evaluating both faces a choice:
- **Forecast**: Migrate everything, get profitability + resource planning + time tracking
- **Murphy**: Keep Jira/Linear, add delivery prediction in a day

### When They'd Pick Forecast

- Want an all-in-one PM platform
- Prioritize project profitability tracking
- Willing to migrate from current tools
- Need built-in time tracking and resource management

### When They'd Pick Murphy

- Don't want to migrate from Jira/Linear/GitHub
- Primarily care about on-time delivery
- Want fast time-to-value (days, not weeks)
- Already have time tracking elsewhere

### Competitive Response

If a prospect is evaluating both:
- Emphasize no migration required
- Focus on speed to value (connect in minutes)
- Acknowledge Forecast's profitability features (if that's their priority, maybe Forecast is right for them)

## Threat Level: Medium

Forecast is a real alternative for teams who want all-in-one. Our advantage is non-disruption: teams can try Murphy without changing anything.
