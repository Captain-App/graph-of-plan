# Brex

Brex is a corporate financial services platform providing credit cards, expense management, banking, and spend controls for startups and enterprises.

## Overview

**Company**: Brex (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2017
**Funding**: $1.2B+ (Series D, Tiger Global, Y Combinator)
**Pricing**: Free tier (Essentials), Premium at $12/user/mo

## Why They're Not a Competitor

**Brex is corporate banking for VC-backed startups. P4gent is an AI assistant for freelancers.**

| | Brex | P4gent |
|---|------|--------|
| **Customer** | Series A+ startups | Freelancers and solopreneurs |
| **Core product** | Banking + corporate cards | AI spending assistant |
| **Value prop** | High-limit cards, no personal guarantee | "Catch forgotten subscriptions" |
| **Minimum bar** | Funded company | Anyone with suppliers |

### The Core Difference

Brex sells status and infrastructure to funded startups. P4gent sells time savings to time-poor individuals.

A Brex customer:
- Has raised venture capital
- Needs corporate banking
- Wants high credit limits without personal guarantees
- Has finance operations to manage

A P4gent customer:
- Freelancer or solo founder
- Uses personal bank accounts
- Wants help tracking subscriptions and suppliers
- Has no finance team (they are the finance team)

### Zero Overlap

These are completely different products for completely different customers. The only shared concept is "managing money"—which is so broad it's meaningless.

Brex moves money. P4gent helps you decide what money to move.

## Threat Level: None

Brex is not building AI assistants for freelancers. P4gent is not building corporate banking. No competition.
