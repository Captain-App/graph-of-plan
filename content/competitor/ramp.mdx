# Ramp

Ramp is a corporate spend management platform combining credit cards, expense management, bill pay, and procurement automation for businesses.

## Overview

**Company**: Ramp (New York)
**Founded**: 2019
**Funding**: $1.6B+ (Series D, Founders Fund, Thrive)
**Pricing**: Free for core features, Ramp Plus at $15/user/mo

## Why They're Not a Competitor

**Ramp needs a funded company with employees. P4gent serves freelancers with personal bank accounts.**

| | Ramp | P4gent |
|---|------|--------|
| **Customer** | Companies with 10+ employees | Solopreneurs and freelancers |
| **Core product** | Corporate cards | AI spending assistant |
| **Revenue model** | Card interchange | £9-79/mo subscription |
| **Integration** | Replace your banking | Connect to existing accounts |

### The Core Difference

Ramp is financial infrastructure for funded startups. P4gent is an AI assistant for individuals.

To use Ramp, you need:
- A registered company
- Employees who need cards
- Corporate banking setup
- Finance team (or at least finance processes)

To use P4gent, you need:
- An email account
- A Xero/bank connection
- £9/month

### Different Markets Entirely

The overlap is superficial. Yes, both care about "managing spend." But:

- A freelancer with 15 SaaS subscriptions and 5 suppliers isn't a Ramp customer
- A Series B startup with 50 employees isn't a P4gent customer

### The Graduation Path

P4gent customers may eventually graduate to Ramp. A solopreneur who grows into a 20-person company will need corporate cards. That's fine—we serve them until they outgrow us.

## Threat Level: None

Different market segment. Ramp isn't moving downmarket to serve freelancers (no interchange revenue there). P4gent isn't moving upmarket to compete with corporate cards.
