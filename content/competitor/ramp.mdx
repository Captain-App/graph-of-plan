## What They Do

Ramp is a spend management platform for growing companies:
- **Corporate cards**: Physical and virtual cards with built-in controls
- **Expense management**: Receipt capture, auto-categorization, approval workflows
- **Bill pay**: Centralized vendor payments
- **Procurement**: Purchase requests and approvals
- **Spend intelligence**: AI-powered savings recommendations

## Where We Overlap

### P4gent vs. Ramp

Both help businesses manage supplier spending. Ramp does it through corporate infrastructure; P4gent does it through AI assistance.

**Shared concerns**:
- Where is money going?
- Are we overpaying?
- What subscriptions do we have?
- When are renewals?

## Our Differentiation

### Different Value Prop

| Dimension | Ramp | P4gent |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Business model** | Card interchange | Subscription SaaS |
| **Target** | Funded startups, mid-market | Solopreneurs, SMBs |
| **Approach** | Control spending | Assist with spending decisions |
| **Integration** | Replace your card | Connect to existing accounts |
| **Scope** | Company-wide | Individual/small team |

### Key Differences

1. **Scale**: Ramp is for companies with procurement needs. P4gent is for individuals and tiny teams.

2. **Infrastructure vs. Intelligence**: Ramp is financial infrastructure (cards, payments). P4gent is intelligence on top of existing infrastructure.

3. **Control vs. Advice**: Ramp enforces policies. P4gent suggests and drafts.

4. **Downmarket**: Ramp doesn't serve solopreneurs. P4gent does.

5. **Human in the loop**: P4gent keeps humans making decisions. Ramp automates away the human.

## Their Advantages

- **Free tier**: Hard to compete with free cards
- **Funding**: Massive war chest for growth
- **Network effects**: More data = better insights
- **Full stack**: Cards + expenses + bills in one
- **Enterprise sales**: Strong upmarket motion
- **Brand**: Fast-growing, highly visible startup

## Positioning

Ramp is the best corporate card for funded startups and growth companies. P4gent is for the millions of businesses too small for Ramp.

**Our pitch to Ramp prospects**: "If you don't need corporate cards—just help managing suppliers—P4gent is simpler."

**Our pitch to solopreneurs**: "Ramp is for companies with finance teams. P4gent is your finance team of one."

## Why We Don't Compete Head-to-Head

Different market segments:
- Ramp: 10+ employees, funded, needs corporate cards
- P4gent: 1-10 people, bootstrapped, uses personal cards

P4gent customers may graduate to Ramp. That's fine—we serve them until they need infrastructure we don't provide.
