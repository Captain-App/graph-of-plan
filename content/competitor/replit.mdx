# Replit Agent

Replit Agent is an AI-powered development environment that can build full applications from natural language descriptions, with integrated hosting and deployment.

## Overview

**Company**: Replit (San Francisco)
**Founded**: 2016 (Agent launched 2024)
**Funding**: $200M+ (Series B, Andreessen Horowitz)
**Pricing**: Free tier, Core at $20/mo, Teams at $40/user/mo

## Why They're Not a Direct Competitor (Yet)

**Replit builds apps once. SmartBoxes maintain, monitor, and evolve continuously.**

| | Replit Agent | SmartBoxes |
|---|--------------|------------|
| **Interaction** | Chat session | Always-on agent |
| **Lifecycle** | Build → deploy → done | Build → deploy → maintain → iterate |
| **Skills** | General-purpose coding | Pre-packaged capability packs |
| **Memory** | Session-based | Persistent context |

### The Core Difference

Replit Agent is a powerful assistant for a build session. SmartBoxes are persistent agents that live alongside your project indefinitely.

When you close Replit, the session ends. When you close SmartBoxes... you don't. The agent keeps running, monitoring for issues, updating dependencies, responding to external events.

### When They'd Pick Replit

- Building a one-off app or prototype
- Want the familiar IDE experience
- Learning to code with AI help
- Need wide language/framework support

### When They'd Pick SmartBoxes

- Want ongoing automation, not just app building
- Need capability packs (competitor monitoring, documentation, etc.)
- Want agents that work while they sleep
- Need enterprise features (SSO, audit trails)

## Threat Level: Medium-High

Replit is the closest competitor to SmartBoxes. If they add:
- Persistent agents that run between sessions
- Pre-built capability packs
- Enterprise compliance features

...they'd be directly competitive. Watch closely.
