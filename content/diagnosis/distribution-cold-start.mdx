# Distribution Cold Start

We have technical capability but no distribution. Building without distribution is pointless; distribution requires credibility; credibility requires shipped products; shipped products require users we can't reach.

## The Vicious Cycle

1. **Need users to prove value** - Without users, no testimonials, case studies, or word-of-mouth
2. **Need credibility to get users** - "Trust us, it works" doesn't convert
3. **Need distribution to reach prospects** - Can't sell to people who don't know we exist
4. **Need resources to build distribution** - Content, outreach, and community take time

## Why This Is The Critical Challenge

Many things could go wrong. But if we build great products that nobody uses, we've wasted everything. Distribution isn't a marketing problem - it's an existential one.

## What Doesn't Work

- **"Build it and they will come"** - The graveyard is full of great products nobody found
- **Premature scaling** - Paid acquisition without retention is a bonfire
- **Feature obsession** - More features don't create distribution

## The Breakthrough Required

Convert technical capability into credibility, credibility into distribution, distribution into users. The order matters.
