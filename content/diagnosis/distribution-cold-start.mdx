# Distribution Cold Start

No audience, no customers, no track record. The classic chicken-and-egg problem for new products.

## The Challenge

We need customers to prove the product works. We need proof to get customers. Meanwhile:
- No existing audience to launch to
- No case studies or testimonials
- No brand recognition in the space
- No revenue to fund marketing

## Relation to Chain-Link Illegibility

This is a component of the broader [chain-link illegibility](/diagnosis/chain-link-illegibility) challenge. Distribution cold start is the *mechanism* by which the chain remains illegible—we can't demonstrate the chain-link value without customers, and we can't get customers without demonstrating value.

## Why It's Not THE Diagnosis

Distribution cold start is generic—every startup faces it. The deeper insight is that our specific strategy is *illegible until demonstrated*. The chain-link structure means:

- Can't sell Murphy without SmartBoxes working
- Can't sell SmartBoxes without the Murphy vision
- Each link is hard to sell standalone

Distribution cold start is real, but it's a symptom of the deeper illegibility problem.

## How We Navigate It

The [dogfood-first](/guiding-policy/dogfood-first) policy addresses this directly:
1. Be our own first customer
2. Build the proof through internal use
3. The [client validation gate](/action-gate/client-roadmap-validation) proves transferability
4. Only then does distribution become possible

Distribution follows proof, not the other way around.
